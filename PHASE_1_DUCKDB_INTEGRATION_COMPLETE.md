## 🏗️ ARCHITECTURE

### Observability Instrumentation Pattern

All instrumented functions follow a consistent pattern:

```python
def operation_name(...):
    emit_operation_begin(...)  # Emit start event
    start_time = time.time()
    try:
        # ... perform operation ...
        emit_operation_success(...)  # Emit success event
    except Exception as e:
        emit_operation_error(...)  # Emit error event
        raise
```

### Event Categories

1. **Boundary Events**: `emit_boundary_begin/success/error`
2. **Doctor Events**: `emit_doctor_begin/issue_found/fixed/complete`
3. **Prune Events**: `emit_prune_begin/orphan_found/deleted`
4. **CLI Events**: `emit_cli_command_begin/success/error`
5. **Performance Events**: `emit_slow_operation`, `emit_slow_query`
6. **Timing Utilities**: `TimedOperation` context manager

### Integration Points

- **CLI Layer**: All 9 commands emit telemetry
- **Operations Layer**: Boundaries, doctor, GC instrumented
- **Observability Layer**: Structured event emission
- **Database Layer**: DuckDB transactional operations
