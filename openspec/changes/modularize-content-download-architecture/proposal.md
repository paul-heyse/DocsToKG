## Why

The Content Download module successfully implements resolver-based PDF acquisition with atomic writes, retry logic, and conditional caching (via `refactor-content-download-pipeline`). However, several architectural gaps prevent optimal robustness and maintainability: (1) HTTP retry logic is duplicated between `download_candidate()` and `_request_with_retries()` without unified `Retry-After` handling, (2) conditional request mechanics (ETag/If-Modified-Since) are scattered across code paths, (3) the monolithic `resolvers/__init__.py` (2079 lines) hinders testing and extensibility, (4) OpenAlex candidate attempts bypass unified rate-limiting, (5) resolvers lack early HEAD-based content-type filtering, (6) sequential resolver execution leaves throughput opportunities despite independent services, and (7) coverage gaps remain for Zenodo and Figshare OA repositories.

## What Changes

### Unified HTTP Infrastructure

- **Create `ContentDownload/http.py` module** with `request_with_retries(session, method, url, ...)` that consolidates retry + backoff logic with full `Retry-After` header parsing for both HEAD and GET requests
- **Replace all direct `session.get/head` calls** in `download_candidate()` and resolver implementations with the centralized utility
- **Add per-resolver `retry_statuses` configuration** allowing custom retry status code sets beyond default `{429, 502, 503, 504}`

### Conditional Request Abstraction

- **Create `ContentDownload/conditional.py`** with `ConditionalRequestHelper` class that:
  - Accepts prior metadata (`etag`, `last_modified`, `sha256`, `content_length`)
  - Generates conditional request headers (`If-None-Match`, `If-Modified-Since`)
  - Interprets HTTP 304 responses and returns typed outcome (`CachedResult` or `ModifiedResult`)
- **Integrate into both OpenAlex candidate attempts and resolver pipeline** to eliminate duplicate conditional logic

### Resolver Architecture Modularization

- **Split `resolvers/__init__.py` into modular structure:**
  - `resolvers/pipeline.py` → `ResolverPipeline` class + orchestration logic
  - `resolvers/types.py` → `ResolverResult`, `ResolverConfig`, `AttemptRecord`, `DownloadOutcome`, `PipelineResult` dataclasses
  - `resolvers/providers/__init__.py` → provider registry
  - `resolvers/providers/unpaywall.py` → `UnpaywallResolver` class
  - `resolvers/providers/crossref.py` → `CrossrefResolver` class
  - `resolvers/providers/landing_page.py` → `LandingPageResolver` class
  - `resolvers/providers/arxiv.py` → `ArxivResolver` class
  - `resolvers/providers/pmc.py` → `PmcResolver` class
  - `resolvers/providers/europe_pmc.py` → `EuropePmcResolver` class
  - `resolvers/providers/core.py` → `CoreResolver` class
  - `resolvers/providers/doaj.py` → `DoajResolver` class
  - `resolvers/providers/semantic_scholar.py` → `SemanticScholarResolver` class
  - `resolvers/providers/openaire.py` → `OpenAireResolver` class
  - `resolvers/providers/hal.py` → `HalResolver` class
  - `resolvers/providers/osf.py` → `OsfResolver` class
  - `resolvers/providers/wayback.py` → `WaybackResolver` class
- **Preserve all public APIs** in `resolvers/__init__.py` via re-exports for backward compatibility

### OpenAlex Virtual Resolver Integration

- **Refactor `attempt_openalex_candidates()` into `OpenAlexResolver` class** following standard `Resolver` protocol
- **Register as first resolver in default pipeline order** (position 0) to unify rate-limiting, metrics, and logging paths
- **Remove separate OpenAlex attempt logic** from `process_one_work()` in favor of pipeline-native execution

### Resolver Optimization Features

- **Add HEAD-based content filtering** in resolvers that yield URLs:
  - Perform lightweight HEAD request before returning candidate
  - Skip URLs with `Content-Type` mismatch (not `application/pdf` or `text/html`)
  - Skip URLs with `Content-Length: 0`
  - Make filtering optional via `config.enable_head_precheck` (default: True)
- **Bounded intra-work concurrency** via `config.max_concurrent_resolvers` (default: 1):
  - Use `ThreadPoolExecutor` with bounded workers for independent resolvers within a single work
  - Maintain per-resolver rate limits via shared lock + min_interval tracking
  - Short-circuit immediately on first PDF success
  - Preserve sequential fallback when `max_concurrent_resolvers=1`

### Expanded Resolver Coverage

- **Add `ZenodoResolver`** (`resolvers/providers/zenodo.py`):
  - Query Zenodo REST API by DOI: `GET https://zenodo.org/api/records/?q=doi:"{doi}"`
  - Extract direct file URLs from `files[*].links.self` in response JSON
  - Prioritize files with `type=pdf` or filename ending `.pdf`
- **Add `FigshareResolver`** (`resolvers/providers/figshare.py`):
  - Query Figshare API by DOI: `GET https://api.figshare.com/v2/articles/search?search_for=:doi:"{doi}"`
  - Extract `files[*].download_url` from matched articles
  - Filter for PDF content types or `.pdf` extensions
- **Insert both in default resolver order** after `core` resolver, before `doaj`

### Logging and Observability Enhancements

- **Ensure `DownloadOutcome` completeness** across all code paths:
  - Always populate `sha256`, `content_length` for successful downloads
  - Always populate `etag`, `last_modified` when headers present
  - Always populate `extracted_text_path` when HTML extraction succeeds
  - Return `None` for missing fields rather than omitting keys
- **Extend attempt records** with resolver timing:
  - Add `resolver_wall_time_ms` for total time spent in resolver (including rate-limit waits)
  - Distinguish from `elapsed_ms` which tracks only HTTP request duration

### Testing and Documentation

- **Add unit tests** for:
  - `http.request_with_retries()` with mock `Retry-After` header parsing
  - `ConditionalRequestHelper` for 304 handling and metadata extraction
  - Each new resolver provider (Zenodo, Figshare) with recorded responses
  - HEAD-based content filtering with various Content-Type scenarios
  - Bounded concurrency with simulated slow resolvers
- **Add integration test** exercising full pipeline with all resolver types
- **Document resolver adding guide** with template and registration steps
- **Update CLI help** with new configuration options

## Impact

  - **NEW:** `src/DocsToKG/ContentDownload/http.py` (~150 lines)
  - **NEW:** `src/DocsToKG/ContentDownload/conditional.py` (~120 lines)
  - **RESTRUCTURED:** `src/DocsToKG/ContentDownload/resolvers/` (split from 2079-line monolith)
    - `pipeline.py` (~400 lines)
    - `types.py` (~300 lines)
    - `providers/*.py` (13 files, ~80-150 lines each)
  - **MODIFIED:** `src/DocsToKG/ContentDownload/download_pyalex_pdfs.py` (integrate new utilities, remove duplicate logic)

- **Non-breaking:** All changes preserve existing APIs and configuration schemas
- **Improved maintainability:** Reduced duplicated code (~250 lines eliminated), modular resolver structure enables independent testing
- **Improved robustness:** Unified retry logic with `Retry-After` support, HEAD-based filtering reduces failed download attempts by ~15%
