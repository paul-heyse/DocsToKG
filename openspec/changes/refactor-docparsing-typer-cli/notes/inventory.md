# CLI Surface Inventory (Typer Migration)

This note captures the legacy command surfaces prior to the Typer refactor and documents the artefacts produced for parity checks.

- **Commands discovered**: `doctags`, `chunk`, `embed`, `all`, `plan`, `manifest`, `token-profiles`.
- **Legacy help output**: snapshots captured in `notes/help/*.txt` using `python -m DocsToKG.DocParsing.core.cli <command> --help` before and after the Typer conversion. These serve as the reference for flag names, aliases, defaults, and descriptions.
- **Exit/validation behaviour**: Each helper (`doctags()`, `chunk()`, `embed()`, `run_all()`, `manifest()`, `token_profiles()`) still funnels through `_run_stage` where applicable, preserving `CLIValidationError` formatting (exit code `2`) and propagating underlying stage exit codes. Optional dependency failures remain surfaced via the existing ImportError guards in `chunk()` and `token_profiles()`.
- **Backward-compatible shims**: Module-level helpers continue to accept `Sequence[str] | None` so downstream automation can call them directly and receive integer exit codes identical to invoking the CLI.

These artefacts satisfy tasks 1.1.1â€“1.1.3 of the change plan and provide the baseline for regressions while the Typer commands evolve.
