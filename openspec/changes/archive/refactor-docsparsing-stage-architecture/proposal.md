## Why
- `src/DocsToKG/DocParsing/embedding.py` and `src/DocsToKG/DocParsing/chunking.py` each exceed 2k lines and interleave config dataclasses, CLI builders, multiprocessing orchestration, and worker logic, which makes the stage boundaries opaque and complicates testing. Recent regressions show that touching CLI argument parsing pulls in heavyweight runtime imports because everything lives in a single module (`embedding.py:1`, `chunking.py:1`).
- Stage configuration layering masks operator mistakes: `StageConfigBase.update_from_file` silently drops unknown keys and `StageConfigBase.apply_args` skips `None`, so typos or deliberate clears never surface (`src/DocsToKG/DocParsing/config.py:314`, `src/DocsToKG/DocParsing/config.py:344`). This has caused misconfigured runs where an outdated `splade_model_dir` persisted even after operators tried to reset it.
- Runtime globals leak mutable state between stages. The shared HTTP session mutates a module-level singleton (`src/DocsToKG/DocParsing/core.py:726`), and manifest helpers rely on `_STAGE_TELEMETRY` (`src/DocsToKG/DocParsing/logging.py:326`). This makes concurrent stage execution brittle and hides dependencies from tests that patch these functions.
- Both stage CLIs blanket-suppress bootstrap failures (`src/DocsToKG/DocParsing/embedding.py:2351`, `src/DocsToKG/DocParsing/chunking.py:1636`), so missing data directories or permission errors disappear without telemetry, leaving operators with silent skips instead of actionable logs.

## What Changes
- Split the embedding and chunking stages into packages (`DocsToKG.DocParsing.embedding.*`, `DocsToKG.DocParsing.chunking.*`) with explicit layers: `config.py` for dataclasses and parsing, `cli.py` for argument/entrypoint wiring, `runtime.py` (or `runner.py`) for orchestration, and `workers/` for per-document processing. Keep lightweight fa√ßade modules that re-export `main`, `build_parser`, and dataclasses to remain backward compatible.
- Harden configuration layering by teaching `StageConfigBase` (and stage-specific subclasses) to raise on unknown keys, accept explicit clear semantics (empty string CLI arguments, YAML `null`, or a `--clear-foo` flag), and record when a field was reset. Provide targeted warnings when operators request a clear of required fields.
- Introduce stage-scoped context managers that vend HTTP sessions and telemetry writers. Replace the module-level singletons with objects managed by the CLI runner so that tests can inject fakes and concurrent runs do not collide. Ensure session headers, telemetry routing, and cleanup follow deterministic lifetimes.
- Update CLI entrypoints to surface bootstrap errors: log failures with stage context, emit telemetry attempts, and exit non-zero when prerequisite directories cannot be prepared. Maintain current success paths but remove the silent `except Exception: pass` blocks.

## Impact
- Requires updating internal imports to point at the new subpackages while preserving public `DocsToKG.DocParsing.embedding` and `DocsToKG.DocParsing.chunking` surfaces.
- Adds new unit tests for configuration validation, session/telemetry managers, and CLI error propagation; integration test harnesses need updates to instantiate the new runners.
- Operators gain earlier feedback on misconfigured runs (warnings/errors instead of silent defaults), so rollout should include documentation that calls out the stricter config handling.
