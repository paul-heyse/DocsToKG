SIZE = 128 * 1024 * 1024  # 128 MiB

                break
            hasher.update(block)
    digest = hasher.hexdigest()

stream_elapsed, stream_digest = write_streaming(path_stream)
reread_elapsed, reread_digest = write_then_reread(path_reread)

Results:

| Approach             | Duration (s) |
|----------------------|--------------|
| Streaming hasher     | 0.31         |
| Write then re-read   | 0.37         |

The streaming approach reduces the hashing step by approximately **17%** for the
128 MiB payload while producing the same digest.

Additional observations:

- `strace -e trace=read,write -c` confirms the streaming path performs **2048
  write() calls and zero read() calls**, whereas the legacy path performs an
  additional 2048 read() calls during the second pass.
- Network utilisation remains unchanged because both approaches download the
  same payload; only local disk I/O is affected.
- CPU profiling with `py-spy top --duration 5` shows SHA-256 computation
  consumes ~6% of wall time during streaming versus ~5% previously, indicating
  the CPU overhead is amortised without becoming a bottleneck.
