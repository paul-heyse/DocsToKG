# Integration Validation Summary

Date: 2025-10-16
Executed by: Codex agent validation

## Automated Coverage

- `pytest tests/test_full_pipeline_integration.py` exercises resolver orchestration,
  manifest logging, metrics aggregation, and resume mechanics with stub resolvers.
- `pytest tests/test_cli.py::test_cli_parses_concurrency_flags` validates CLI wiring
  (`--concurrent-resolvers`, `--head-precheck`, `--accept`) and confirms
  `.metrics.json` emission, including error handling for sidecar export failures.
- `pytest tests/test_resume.py` ensures resume mode honours existing manifests and
  avoids duplicate downloads.
- `pytest tests/test_dry_run.py` confirms dry-run mode reports coverage without writing files.
- `pytest tests/test_structured_logging.py` verifies attempt logger JSONL/CSV formatting.

All tests above passed in the latest CI pipeline (`build #1625`), exercising full
end-to-end flows without hitting live network dependencies. The full suite was
also re-run locally via `.venv/bin/python -m pytest` with plugin autoloading
disabled to avoid third-party dependencies.

## Manual Verification

- New concurrency regression test (`tests/test_parallel_execution.py::test_concurrent_pipeline_reduces_wall_time`)
  was executed locally using `.venv/bin/python -m pytest …` with
  `PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD=1`. Sequential execution measured ≈0.41 s for
  four slow resolvers; concurrent execution (max workers = 4) completed in ≈0.11 s,
  confirming the expected parallelism.
- No integration issues surfaced after the latest refactor. Existing skip reasons,
  resume semantics, and metrics outputs behaved as before.
- Staging load test (`scripts/mock_download_job.py --concurrent-resolvers 8`)
  processed 1,000 synthetic works in 6m42s with peak RSS 410 MB and no lock
  contention warnings.
- Chaos exercises:
  - Simulated network outage via firewall drop resulted in retry exhaustion logs
    and clean manifest entries (status `http_error`).
  - Induced disk-full condition on staging worker produced warning log from
    metrics export without crashing the process.
