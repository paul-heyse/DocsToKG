# Code Review Verification Checklist

Summary of manual inspection performed on 2025-10-16.

- **Thread safety:** Reviewed `JsonlLogger` and `CsvAttemptLoggerAdapter`
  implementations; both guard writes with `threading.Lock`. Concurrency tests
  (`tests/test_jsonl_logging.py`) confirm no interleaving under 16-way stress.
- **Race conditions:** New pipeline concurrency test demonstrates resolver
  scheduling respects max worker limits without deadlocks. No shared mutable
  structures are written without locks.
- **File handles:** `download_pyalex_pdfs.py` wraps manifest and CSV logger
  closures in `try/finally` blocks; error paths (metrics export) log warnings
  without leaking descriptors.
- **Exception handling:** Centralised retry helper propagates `RequestException`
  with contextual warnings; metrics export and summary logging swallow failures
  only after recording structured warnings.
- **Backward compatibility:** Manifest records retain schema; global dedupe
  and domain throttling remain opt-in with defaults matching previous releases.
