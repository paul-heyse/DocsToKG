## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Documentation Framework Structure

The system SHALL maintain a hierarchical documentation structure that enables AI agents and human contributors to quickly understand project requirements and produce aligned code.

#### Scenario: Documentation structure accessibility

- **WHEN** an AI agent or developer needs to understand project requirements
- **THEN** they can navigate a clear hierarchical structure starting from high-level concepts to implementation details
- **AND** find relevant information within 3-4 clicks or searches

#### Scenario: Documentation completeness

- **WHEN** viewing any major component or feature
- **THEN** comprehensive documentation is available including purpose, usage, and integration points
- **AND** documentation is current and accurate

### Requirement: Automated Documentation Maintenance

The system SHALL automatically maintain documentation currency and quality to ensure AI agents have access to current project information.

#### Scenario: Automated documentation generation

- **WHEN** code is committed with proper annotations
- **THEN** API documentation is automatically generated and updated
- **AND** changes are reflected in the documentation repository

#### Scenario: Documentation validation

- **WHEN** a pull request is submitted
- **THEN** documentation completeness and quality are automatically validated
- **AND** broken links and formatting issues are detected

#### Scenario: Documentation health monitoring

- **WHEN** documentation issues are detected
- **THEN** automated reports are generated for maintenance
- **AND** stakeholders are notified of documentation drift

### Requirement: Documentation Standards and Best Practices

The system SHALL enforce consistent documentation standards that enable AI agents to quickly parse and understand project requirements.

#### Scenario: Style guide compliance

- **WHEN** documentation is created or updated
- **THEN** it adheres to established style guidelines for consistency
- **AND** automated tools validate formatting and terminology

#### Scenario: Code annotation standards

- **WHEN** developers write code
- **THEN** they follow structured commenting patterns that enable automated documentation generation
- **AND** AI agents can extract requirements and usage information from code

#### Scenario: Documentation templates

- **WHEN** new documentation is needed
- **THEN** standardized templates are available for different documentation types
- **AND** templates guide contributors to include all necessary information

### Requirement: Documentation Integration with Development Workflow

The system SHALL integrate documentation requirements into the development process to ensure documentation evolves with code.

#### Scenario: PR documentation requirements

- **WHEN** a pull request is created
- **THEN** documentation updates are required for significant changes
- **AND** automated checks verify documentation completeness

#### Scenario: Documentation review process

- **WHEN** documentation changes are proposed
- **THEN** they follow a clear review and approval process
- **AND** feedback is incorporated before merging

#### Scenario: Documentation maintenance scheduling

- **WHEN** documentation maintenance is scheduled
- **THEN** automated reminders and processes ensure regular updates
- **AND** documentation currency is maintained

### Requirement: AI Agent Documentation Optimization

The system SHALL optimize documentation structure and content for AI agent consumption to enable rapid understanding and code generation.

#### Scenario: AI-readable documentation format

- **WHEN** AI agents access documentation
- **THEN** content is structured in parseable formats (Markdown, structured data)
- **AND** key information is clearly delimited and indexed

#### Scenario: Context building for AI agents

- **WHEN** AI agents need project context
- **THEN** documentation provides logical progression from high-level concepts to implementation details
- **AND** cross-references enable building complete understanding

#### Scenario: Requirements extraction for AI agents

- **WHEN** AI agents analyze project requirements
- **THEN** functional and non-functional requirements are clearly stated
- **AND** acceptance criteria and scenarios are provided for validation
