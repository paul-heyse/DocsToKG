2. **No Download Loop Integration** (download.py) - ❌
   - Missing: Job planning calls
   - Missing: State machine advancement
   - Missing: Effect logging for operations
   - Impact: Downloaded files not tracked for idempotency

3. **No Configuration** - ❌

   - Missing: `job leases` subcommand
   - Impact: No operational visibility

5. **No AGENTS.md Documentation** - ❌
   - Missing: Usage patterns
   - Missing: Operational playbooks
   - Missing: CLI examples
   - Impact: Operations team cannot manage system

### Production Readiness Gaps

| Requirement | Status | Effort |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Feature gate | ❌ | 2 hours |
| Download integration | ❌ | 4 hours |
| Configuration | ❌ | 1 hour |
| CLI commands | ❌ | 2 hours |

## DATA PROPAGATION STATUS

### Current: Component-Ready (NOT Production-Deployed)

```
✅ MODULES COMPLETE
   └─ 7 modules (1200+ LOC)
   └─ 22 tests (100% passing)
   └─ Production-quality code
   └─ Full documentation

⏳ INTEGRATION PENDING
   └─ Feature gate (runner.py)
   └─ Download loop (download.py)
   └─ Configuration
   └─ CLI commands
   └─ AGENTS.md docs

❌ PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT BLOCKED
   └─ Awaiting Phase 9-10 work
   └─ Cannot be enabled without integration
   └─ Cannot be monitored without CLI commands
```

### To Reach Full Production:

**Phase 9 (Integration) - 1 week:**
1. Feature gate in runner.py
2. Job planning/leasing in download.py
3. Configuration loading
4. Integration testing

**Phase 10 (Operations) - 4 days:**
1. CLI status commands
2. AGENTS.md documentation
3. Operational runbooks
4. Manual testing

**Result**: Fully production-deployed idempotency system

## DATABASE PRODUCTION CHECKS

| Check | Status | Location |
|-------|--------|----------|
| WAL mode enabled | ✅ | schema_migration.py |
| FOREIGN_KEYS enabled | ✅ | schema_migration.py |
| SYNCHRONOUS=NORMAL | ✅ | schema_migration.py |
| Index on state | ✅ | schema_migration.py |
| Index on lease_until | ✅ | schema_migration.py |
| Busy timeout set | ✅ | schema_migration.py |
| Connection pooling | ❌ | Deferred to Phase 1b |

**Single-machine (1-10 workers)**: ✅ Ready  
**Single-machine (10-100 workers)**: ⚠️ Untested  
**Multi-machine**: ❌ Not implemented (needs Redis, Phase 1b)

---

## SCALE READINESS

### Single Machine (1-100 workers)

**Current**: ✅ Ready with SQLite WAL + file locking

**Tested at**:
- ✅ 22 unit tests (concurrent leasing)
- ⚠️ Not stress-tested with 1K+ jobs

**Risk**: Medium concurrency (10-100 workers) untested

### Multiple Machines

**Current**: ❌ Not supported

**Path**: Phase 1b - Redis support for distributed job leasing

## PRODUCTION READINESS VERDICT

### ✅ COMPONENT LEVEL: PRODUCTION-READY

The idempotency **system code** (7 modules) is:
- ✅ Complete
- ✅ Tested (22/22 passing)
- ✅ Documented
- ✅ Type-hinted
- ✅ Zero dependencies
- ✅ Backward compatible

### ❌ INTEGRATION LEVEL: NOT YET DEPLOYED

The idempotency system is **NOT propagated** into production because:
- ❌ No feature gate (cannot be enabled)
- ❌ No download loop wiring (not used)
- ❌ No configuration (cannot tune)
- ❌ No CLI commands (not observable)
- ❌ No AGENTS.md docs (operations cannot manage)

### �� DEPLOYMENT STATUS

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| Can deploy modules? | ✅ Yes (optional feature) |
| Can enable in production? | ❌ No (feature gate missing) |
| Will affect existing code? | ❌ No (disabled by default) |
| Risk of deployment? | ✅ Zero (backward compatible) |
| Timeline to production? | ⏳ 9 days (Phases 9-10) |

## NEXT STEPS

### Phase 9: Integration (Week 1, HIGH PRIORITY)

1. Feature gate in runner.py (enable/disable)
2. Download loop integration (job tracking)
3. Configuration loading (YAML + env vars)
4. Integration testing (backward compat + new features)

### Phase 10: Operations (4 days, HIGH PRIORITY)

1. CLI status commands (`job status`, `job leases`)
2. AGENTS.md documentation (usage, playbooks)
3. Operational runbooks (5 scenarios)
4. Manual testing (crash recovery, multi-worker)

### Phase 1b: Scale (2 weeks, MEDIUM PRIORITY)

1. Load testing (1K+ concurrent jobs)
2. Connection pooling (reduce contention)
3. Redis support (distributed deployments)
4. Performance tuning

---

## CONCLUSION

The **data model & idempotency system** is **ready for integration** into the production download pipeline. All components are complete, tested, and production-quality code.

The system is currently **NOT in production** because integration work (Phases 9-10) has not yet been completed. Once integrated, it will provide:

- ✅ Exactly-once guarantees for all downloads
- ✅ Automatic crash recovery
- ✅ Multi-worker coordination
- ✅ Operational visibility (CLI commands)
- ✅ Zero breaking changes

**Estimated time to full production deployment: 9 days (Phases 9-10)**
