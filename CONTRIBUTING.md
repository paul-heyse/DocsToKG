# Contributing to DocsToKG

Welcome to the DocsToKG project! We appreciate your interest in contributing to our document-to-knowledge-graph system. This guide will help you get started with contributing effectively.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Read our documentation** - Start with the [Overview](./docs/01-overview/) and [Development Guide](./docs/05-development/)
2. **Set up your environment** - Follow the [Setup Guide](./docs/02-setup/)
3. **Explore the codebase** - Understand our [Architecture](./docs/03-architecture/) and [API](./docs/04-api/)
4. **Find an issue** - Look for [good first issues](https://github.com/paul-heyse/DocsToKG/labels/good%20first%20issue) or [help wanted](https://github.com/paul-heyse/DocsToKG/labels/help%20wanted)
5. **Make your contribution** - Follow our development workflow and standards

## üìö Documentation Contributions

### Documentation-First Approach

DocsToKG follows a **documentation-first development** philosophy:

- **Write documentation** before implementing new features
- **Update documentation** when modifying existing functionality
- **Review documentation** as part of code review process
- **Maintain documentation** through automated tools and processes

### How to Contribute to Documentation

1. **Identify areas for improvement**
   - Unclear explanations or missing information
   - Outdated examples or screenshots
   - Broken links or formatting issues

2. **Follow our standards**
   - Use the [Style Guide](./docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md) for writing consistency
   - Follow [Code Annotation Standards](./docs/CODE_ANNOTATION_STANDARDS.md) for code documentation
   - Use provided [templates](./docs/templates/) for new documentation

3. **Submit your changes**
   - Create a pull request with clear description
   - Include before/after comparisons for significant changes
   - Test your documentation changes

### Documentation Tools

```bash
# Generate all documentation
python docs/scripts/generate_all_docs.py

# Validate documentation quality
python docs/scripts/validate_docs.py

# Check for broken links
python docs/scripts/check_links.py

# Validate code annotations
python docs/scripts/validate_code_annotations.py src/
```

## üíª Code Contributions

### Development Workflow

1. **Fork the repository** and create a feature branch
2. **Set up your development environment** (see [Setup Guide](./docs/02-setup/))
3. **Write tests** for new functionality
4. **Follow our coding standards** (see [Development Guide](./docs/05-development/))
5. **Update documentation** for any user-facing changes
6. **Submit a pull request** with comprehensive description

### Code Standards

- **Python 3.12+** with type hints
- **Black** for code formatting
- **isort** for import sorting
- **ruff** and **mypy** for linting/type checks
- **pytest** for testing
- **Comprehensive docstrings** for all public interfaces

### Testing Requirements

- **Unit tests** for all new functionality
- **Integration tests** for API changes
- **Documentation examples** that actually work
- **Performance tests** for significant changes

## üîÑ Review Process

### Documentation Review

All documentation changes follow our [Documentation Review Process](./docs/DOCUMENTATION_REVIEW_PROCESS.md):

- **Automated validation** runs on all changes
- **Human review** for significant updates
- **Quality checklist** ensures consistency
- **AI agent compatibility** verification

### Code Review

Code contributions follow our standard review process:

- **Automated checks** for formatting and basic quality
- **Peer review** by maintainers and contributors
- **Testing requirements** must be met
- **Documentation updates** required for user-facing changes

## üêõ Reporting Issues

### Bug Reports

When reporting bugs, please include:

- **Clear description** of the issue
- **Steps to reproduce** the problem
- **Expected behavior** vs actual behavior
- **Environment information** (OS, Python version, etc.)

### Feature Requests

For feature requests, please provide:

- **Problem statement** - what issue does this solve?
- **Proposed solution** - how should it work?
- **Use cases** - who would benefit and how?
