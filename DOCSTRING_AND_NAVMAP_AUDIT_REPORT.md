# Module Docstrings & NAVMAP Audit Report - Public API Migration

**Date:** October 21, 2025  
**Scope:** Verify and update all module docstrings, NAVMAPs, and README-style descriptions  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - All accurate and up to date

## Executive Summary

Comprehensive audit and update of module documentation across DocParsing core modules affected by the public API migration from `_acquire_lock()` to `safe_write()`. All docstrings, NAVMAPs, and module-level documentation have been reviewed and updated to accurately reflect:

1. **New public API** (`safe_write()`)
2. **Lock-aware writer components** (`JsonlWriter`, `DEFAULT_JSONL_WRITER`)
3. **Dependency injection patterns** for testability
4. **Current module responsibilities** and capabilities

## Modules Audited & Updated

### 1. `src/DocsToKG/DocParsing/core/concurrency.py`

**Status:** ✅ UPDATED

**Previous Docstring:**
```
Process-safety helpers for DocParsing pipelines.

Chunking and embedding stages parallelise work across processes and threads,
so they need lightweight primitives that keep manifests and network resources
safe. This module provides advisory lock management, portable multiprocessing
spawn controls, and free-port discovery routines that help the CLI coordinate
Docling/vLLM workers without relying on heavyweight dependencies.
```

**Updated Docstring:**
```
Process-safety helpers for DocParsing pipelines.

Chunking and embedding stages parallelise work across processes and threads,
so they need lightweight primitives that keep manifests and network resources
safe. This module provides:

- safe_write(): Public API for atomic file writes with process-safe FileLock
- Portable multiprocessing spawn controls via set_spawn_or_warn()
- Free-port discovery routines via find_free_port()
- Reserved port enumeration via ReservedPort

These helpers coordinate Docling/vLLM workers without relying on heavyweight
dependencies. The safe_write() function is the recommended way to atomically
write files when multiple processes may access them concurrently.

Example:
    from DocsToKG.DocParsing.core import safe_write
    from pathlib import Path
    
    # Atomically write a file with process-safe locking
    wrote = safe_write(
        Path("output.json"),
        lambda: save_json_to_output(),
        timeout=60.0,
        skip_if_exists=True
    )
```

**Changes:**
- ✅ Listed all public exports
- ✅ Added `safe_write()` as primary public API
- ✅ Included usage example
- ✅ Clarified this is the recommended approach

### 2. `src/DocsToKG/DocParsing/core/__init__.py`

**Status:** ✅ UPDATED

**Previous Docstring:**
```
Core namespace aggregating shared DocParsing orchestration helpers.

This package surface brings together the reusable CLI builders, batching and
planning utilities, manifest writers, filesystem helpers, and environment
bootstrap logic that power every DocParsing stage. Downstream code can import
from ``DocsToKG.DocParsing.core`` to access opinionated defaults, advisory
locks, resume-safe JSONL writers, and tokenizer/embedding initialisation
routines without needing to know which submodule provides each feature.

**Updated Docstring:**
```
Core namespace aggregating shared DocParsing orchestration helpers.

This package surface brings together reusable CLI builders, batching and planning
utilities, manifest writers, filesystem helpers, and environment bootstrap logic
that power every DocParsing stage. 

Downstream code can import from ``DocsToKG.DocParsing.core`` to access:
- Process-safe file writes via safe_write()
- Opinionated defaults and resume-safe JSONL writers
- Portable multiprocessing coordination (set_spawn_or_warn, find_free_port)
- Tokenizer and embedding initialization routines
- Manifest and filesystem helpers

All features are available from this top-level namespace without needing to know
which submodule provides each feature.

Example:
    from DocsToKG.DocParsing.core import safe_write, set_spawn_or_warn
    from pathlib import Path
    
    # Atomically write output with process safety
    safe_write(Path("results.json"), lambda: save_results())
    
    # Configure subprocess spawning strategy
    set_spawn_or_warn()
```

**Changes:**
- ✅ Bullet-pointed key exports for clarity
- ✅ Emphasized `safe_write()` as primary public API
- ✅ Added practical usage examples
- ✅ Updated terminology ("advisory locks" → "process-safe file writes")

### 3. `src/DocsToKG/DocParsing/io.py`

**Status:** ✅ UPDATED

**Previous Docstring:**
```
Low-level I/O helpers shared across DocParsing stages.

This module houses JSONL streaming utilities, atomic write helpers, and manifest
bookkeeping routines. It deliberately avoids importing the CLI-facing modules so
that other packages can depend on these primitives without pulling in heavy
dependencies.
```

**Updated Docstring:**
```
Low-level I/O helpers shared across DocParsing stages.

This module provides JSONL streaming utilities, atomic write helpers, and manifest
bookkeeping routines that power the resume and observability infrastructure. It
deliberately avoids importing CLI-facing modules so other packages can depend on
these primitives without pulling in heavy dependencies.

Key Components:
- JsonlWriter: Lock-aware JSONL append writer for concurrent-safe telemetry writes
- atomic_write: Atomic file writing with fsync durability and parent directory creation
- jsonl_append_iter: Streaming JSONL appends with optional atomicity
- Manifest indexing and hash computation for content verification
- Unicode normalization helpers for cross-platform path handling

The JsonlWriter is the recommended interface for appending to shared manifest or
attempt log files, as it serializes concurrent writers using FileLock and ensures
atomic writes even under concurrent access.

Example:
    from DocsToKG.DocParsing.io import DEFAULT_JSONL_WRITER
    from pathlib import Path
    
    # Atomically append manifest entries using lock-aware writer
    rows = [{"id": "doc1", "status": "completed"}]
    DEFAULT_JSONL_WRITER(Path("manifest.jsonl"), rows)
```

**Changes:**
- ✅ Highlighted `JsonlWriter` as new component
- ✅ Listed key components with brief descriptions
- ✅ Recommended `JsonlWriter` over manual locking
- ✅ Added usage example showing `DEFAULT_JSONL_WRITER`

### 4. `src/DocsToKG/DocParsing/telemetry.py`

**Status:** ✅ UPDATED

**Previous Docstring:**
```
Telemetry data structures and JSONL sinks for DocParsing stages.

Each stage records structured attempts and manifest entries to support resume
logic and observability dashboards. This module defines the dataclasses used to
represent those events plus ``TelemetrySink`` implementations that append them
to JSONL files using a lock-aware writer, guaranteeing atomic writes even when
multiple processes report progress concurrently.
```

**Updated Docstring:**
```
Telemetry data structures and JSONL sinks for DocParsing stages.

Each stage records structured attempts and manifest entries to support resume
logic and observability dashboards. This module defines dataclasses for representing
those events plus TelemetrySink implementations that append them to JSONL files
using a lock-aware writer (via dependency injection), guaranteeing atomic writes
even when multiple processes report progress concurrently.

Key Components:
- Attempt: Dataclass representing a single processing attempt (status, duration, metadata)
- ManifestEntry: Dataclass representing successful pipeline output (tokens, schema version)
- TelemetrySink: Manages persistent storage of attempts and manifest entries to JSONL
- StageTelemetry: Binds a sink to a specific run ID and stage name for convenient logging
- DEFAULT_JSONL_WRITER: Provides lock-aware appending for concurrent-safe writes

The TelemetrySink and StageTelemetry accept an optional writer dependency (defaulting
to DEFAULT_JSONL_WRITER), enabling both production use and test injection of custom
writers without modifying telemetry logic.

Example:
    from DocsToKG.DocParsing.telemetry import TelemetrySink, StageTelemetry
    from pathlib import Path
    
    # Create a telemetry sink for a pipeline run
    sink = TelemetrySink(
        attempts_path=Path("attempts.jsonl"),
        manifest_path=Path("manifest.jsonl")
    )
    
    # Bind to a specific stage and run
    stage_telemetry = StageTelemetry(
        sink=sink,
        run_id="run-2025-10-21",
        stage="embedding"
    )
    
    # Log attempt completion (uses lock-aware writer internally)
    stage_telemetry.log_attempt_success(
        file_id="doc1",
        duration_s=1.23,
        output_path="vectors.npy"
    )
```

**Changes:**
- ✅ Highlighted dependency injection pattern
- ✅ Listed key components with responsibilities
- ✅ Documented both production and test patterns
- ✅ Added comprehensive usage example

### 5. `src/DocsToKG/DocParsing/doctags.py`

**Status:** ✅ UPDATED

**Previous Docstring:**
```
DocParsing Doctags Pipeline Utilities

This module hosts the PDF → DocTags conversion workflow _and_ shared helpers
used by other DocParsing doctags pipelines. It coordinates vLLM server lifecycle,
manifest bookkeeping, and CLI argument scaffolding so chunking and embedding
components can import consistent behaviours.

Key Features:
- Shared CLI helpers (`add_data_root_option`, `add_resume_force_options`,
  `prepare_data_root`, `resolve_pipeline_path`) to centralise directory and
  resume/force handling.
- PDF conversion pipeline that spins up a vLLM inference server, distributes
  work across processes, and writes DocTags with manifest telemetry.
- Utility routines for manifest updates, GPU resource configuration, and
  polite rate control against vLLM endpoints.

Usage:
    from DocsToKG.DocParsing import doctags as doctags_module

    parser = doctags_module.pdf_build_parser()
    args = parser.parse_args(["--data-root", "/datasets/Data"])
    exit_code = doctags_module.pdf_main(args)
```

**Updated Docstring:**
```
DocParsing Doctags Pipeline Utilities

This module implements the PDF and HTML conversion stages of DocParsing, transforming
document files into structured tags and formatted text. Output is atomically written
using process-safe file operations (safe_write).

Key Features:
- PDF processing via Docling with optional vLLM LLM support
- HTML processing via BeautifulSoup4 and structured extraction
- Parallel processing through concurrent task dispatch
- vLLM server lifecycle coordination
- Manifest bookkeeping and telemetry

Usage:
    from DocsToKG.DocParsing import doctags as doctags_module

    parser = doctags_module.pdf_build_parser()
    args = parser.parse_args(["--data-root", "/datasets/Data"])
    exit_code = doctags_module.pdf_main(args)
```

**Changes:**
- ✅ Emphasized PDF and HTML processing capabilities
- ✅ Referenced `safe_write()` for atomic writes
- ✅ Simplified and updated key features list
- ✅ Maintained existing usage examples
