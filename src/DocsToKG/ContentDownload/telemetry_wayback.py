"""Telemetry helpers for the Wayback fallback pipeline.

This module provides a very small abstraction that mimics the portions of
the internal telemetry surface used by the tests in this kata.  The real
project tracks a significant amount of metadata; however, for the purposes of
these exercises we only need deterministic counters for the number of
candidate and discovery events emitted during an attempt, plus a lightweight
CDX sampling budget.  Historically the counters lived on the telemetry
instance which meant that successive attempts accidentally shared state.  The
tests target a regression where a single run produced multiple attempts and
the counters were never reset, resulting in incorrect sampling decisions.

The implementation below stores the counters directly on the
``AttemptContext`` returned by :func:`WaybackTelemetry.start_attempt`.  Each
call now receives a fresh context with zeroed counters and a replenished
sampling budget.  The emitters simply consult and update the context so the
behaviour is scoped to a single attempt.
