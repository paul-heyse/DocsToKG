## Overview

**P2.4: Integration Tests** is a comprehensive test suite validating the idempotency system's feature gates, crash recovery, multi-worker coordination, and error handling.

### Deliverables

- ✅ **23 integration tests** covering 9 distinct test classes
- ✅ **Feature gate behavior** (enabled/disabled scenarios)
- ✅ **Crash recovery** (stale leases, abandoned ops)
- ✅ **Multi-worker coordination** (leasing, exclusivity)
- ✅ **Error handling** (graceful degradation)
- ✅ **State machine enforcement** (monotonic transitions)
- ✅ **Idempotency key generation** (deterministic, collision-resistant)
- ✅ **Lease renewal** (TTL management)

### Test File

**Location:** `tests/content_download/test_feature_gates_integration.py`
**Lines:** 480 LOC
**Tests:** 23 organized in 9 test classes

## Test Breakdown by Category

### 1. TestFeatureGateBackwardCompatibility (2 tests)

**Purpose:** Ensure backward compatibility when feature gate is disabled.

```python
✅ test_legacy_mode_downloads_work_without_idempotency
   - Downloads execute normally without idempotency tracking
   - Database remains functional for other operations

✅ test_legacy_mode_no_database_writes
   - Legacy mode doesn't attempt to write to idempotency tables
   - DOCSTOKG_ENABLE_IDEMPOTENCY=false prevents operations
```

### 2. TestFeatureGateEnabled (2 tests)

**Purpose:** Verify idempotency tracking when feature is enabled.

```python
✅ test_feature_enabled_jobs_are_tracked
   - Jobs are tracked in artifact_jobs table when enabled
   - Job state initialized to PLANNED

✅ test_feature_enabled_operations_are_logged
   - Operations are logged to artifact_ops table
   - Operation type and result tracked correctly
```

### 3. TestCrashRecovery (3 tests)

**Purpose:** Verify crash recovery mechanisms and reconciliation.

```python
✅ test_crash_after_lease_recovery
   - Stale leases from crashed workers are recovered
   - cleanup_stale_leases() clears expired ownership

✅ test_crash_after_state_advance
   - Crash after state change detected on recovery
   - State machine enforces monotonic progression

✅ test_crash_after_effect_completion
   - Operations are idempotent after crash
   - Repeated operation with same key returns cached result
```

### 4. TestMultiWorkerCoordination (3 tests)

**Purpose:** Verify safe multi-worker coordination via leasing.

```python
✅ test_two_workers_only_one_claims_job
   - Only one worker can claim a job at a time
   - Leasing enforces exclusive access

✅ test_multiple_workers_multiple_jobs
   - Multiple workers can claim different jobs
   - Parallel processing across distinct jobs

✅ test_concurrent_lease_attempts_thread_safe
   - Concurrent attempts are serialized correctly
   - Lease atomicity maintained under contention
```

### 5. TestErrorHandling (3 tests)

**Purpose:** Verify error handling and graceful degradation.

```python
✅ test_database_unavailable_graceful_degradation
   - System handles missing database connection
   - No exceptions raised, graceful fallback

✅ test_invalid_state_transition_raises
   - Invalid state transitions raise RuntimeError
   - Clear error messages with diagnostics

✅ test_wrong_worker_cannot_renew_lease
   - Wrong worker cannot renew another's lease
   - Lease ownership strictly enforced
```

### 6. TestStateTransitionMonotonicity (2 tests)

**Purpose:** Verify monotonic state machine enforcement.

```python
✅ test_cannot_go_backward_in_state
   - Cannot transition to invalid states
   - Transitions from disallowed states raise errors

✅ test_full_lifecycle_transitions
   - Full happy-path state progression works
   - PLANNED → LEASED → HEAD_DONE → STREAMING → FINALIZED
```

### 7. TestIdempotencyKeyGeneration (3 tests)

**Purpose:** Verify deterministic key generation.

```python
✅ test_same_inputs_produce_same_job_key
   - Job keys are deterministic
   - Same inputs always produce same key

✅ test_same_inputs_produce_same_op_key
   - Operation keys are deterministic
   - Ensures idempotency across retries

✅ test_different_inputs_different_keys
   - Different inputs produce different keys
   - No key collisions for distinct operations
```

### 8. TestFeatureGateViaEnvironment (3 tests)

**Purpose:** Verify environment variable override mechanism.

```python
✅ test_env_var_enables_feature
   - DOCSTOKG_ENABLE_IDEMPOTENCY=true enables feature
   - CLI override mechanism works

✅ test_env_var_disables_feature
   - DOCSTOKG_ENABLE_IDEMPOTENCY=false disables feature
   - Backward compatibility maintained

✅ test_missing_env_var_defaults_to_false
   - Missing env var defaults to false
   - Safe default for backward compatibility
```

### 9. TestLeaseRenewal (2 tests)

**Purpose:** Verify lease renewal for long-running operations.

```python
✅ test_lease_renewal_extends_ttl
   - Renewing lease extends TTL for long operations
   - Prevents timeout during streaming

✅ test_lease_release_for_cleanup
   - Lease can be released for cleanup
   - Another worker can claim after release and state reset
```
