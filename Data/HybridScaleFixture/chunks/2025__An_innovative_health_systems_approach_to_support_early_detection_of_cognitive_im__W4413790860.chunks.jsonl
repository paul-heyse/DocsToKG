Patients who scored likely cognitively impaired or borderline for impairment were eligible for referral to the BHN. Clinics and providers could determine if referrals were automatic or on a patient-by-patient basis. The BHN encounter included a comprehensive assessment of standardized tools and suggested laboratory and imaging studies to facilitate the diagnostic process and connect patients to resources, care and treatment, and research opportunities.\n\nAn innovative health systems approach to support early detection of cognitive impairment in primary care - the brain health navigator\nAbstract\nResults\n466 of 861 patients with likely impaired or borderline impaired DCA results were referred to the BHN.More patients with likely impaired scores (62.7%) were referred to the BHN compared to those with borderline scores (47.6%). Of the 466 referred patients, 28.9% with likely impaired scores and 23.5% with borderline scores completed a BHN visit. Patients who were seen by the BHN had a significantly higher likelihood of receiving a new diagnosis of MCI than patients who did not see the BHN and were more likely to have orders for diagnostic tests, such as vitamin B12 thyroid function and Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the head and neck. Referrals to both neurology and neuropsychology were significantly more common among patients who completed the BHN visit.\n\nAn innovative health systems approach to support early detection of cognitive impairment in primary care - the brain health navigator\nAbstract\nConclusions\nA BHN enhances follow-up care and monitoring for patients with abnormal cognitive screening tests.

A key component of AWVs is the detection of cognitive impairment through clinician observation, family-reported observations, or the use of brief cognitive assessment tools [\n2\n]. However, the uptake and effectiveness of the AWV has been limited due to underutilization, lack of a recommended cognitive assessment tool, and lack of follow up of abnormal cognitive assessments [\n3\n,\n4\n,\n5\n,\n6\n,\n7\n].\nOne of the most cited barriers to early detection of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) in primary care is the lack of a structured process for diagnostic follow-up when a patient screens as cognitively impaired or presents with subjective cognitive complaints. This is compounded for primary care providers by barriers such as limited time, access to informants who know the patient well, and a lack of comfort or confidence in talking about cognition alone or within the context of other chronic conditions [\n8\n,\n9\n]. From the perspective of the patient, barriers to early detection include lack of knowledge about the differences between symptoms of early dementia versus normal aging [\n6\n,\n7\n], stigma around dementia and fear of potential loss of autonomy, and uncertainty about navigating the healthcare system following an abnormal cognitive screening. These barriers create gaps for patients that lead to underdiagnosis, delayed diagnoses, reduced access to treatment, decreased involvement in clinical research, worse behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, and poor management of comorbidities [\n10\n,\n11\n]. As a result, patients with dementia frequently have higher healthcare utilization and worse health outcomes, which may lead to an increased burden and higher stress of family caregivers [\n12\n,\n13\n].", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/54", "#/texts/55", "#/texts/56", "#/texts/57", "#/texts/58", "#/texts/59", "#/texts/60", "#/texts/61", "#/texts/62", "#/texts/63", "#/texts/64", "#/texts/65", "#/texts/66", "#/texts/67", "#/texts/68", "#/texts/69", "#/texts/70", "#/texts/71", "#/texts/72", "#/texts/73", "#/texts/74", "#/texts/75", "#/texts/76", "#/texts/77", "#/texts/78", "#/texts/79", "#/texts/80", "#/texts/81", "#/texts/82", "#/texts/83", "#/texts/84", "#/texts/85"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "cbb6fb55-c0b1-4a3b-8995-9da7425cd5d8"}

For example, in cancer care, nurse navigators have been shown to successfully increase patient rates of adherence to follow-up care after an abnormal screening, increase patient satisfaction, and decrease anxiety [\n2\n,\n14\n,\n15\n,\n16\n,\n17\n]. Patient navigation in primary care emerged in the 1990\u2009s and has grown as a method to facilitate access to care, bridge gaps in care for complex patients caused by healthcare fragmentation, assist in coordinating care across the healthcare system continuum, and connect patients and their families and caregivers to community resources [\n18\n]. Nurse navigator models in primary care have been shown to reduce barriers to specialty care for patients with chronic diseases, have high provider and patient satisfaction [\n19\n], and significantly improve adherence to recommended care [\n20\n].\nThe recommended evaluation following a positive screening test for cognitive impairment in primary care [\n21\n] has many of the complex elements that are ideal for care navigation. For example, further initial workup may include a detailed review of comorbidities, reconciliation and review of prescription and over-the-counter medications, screening for depression, identification of laboratory abnormalities, an assessment of structural brain changes such as vascular disease, stroke, or atrophy, and patient education. Increasing the reliability and effectiveness of a primary care-based diagnostic evaluation process through the use of care navigation has the potential to improve the diagnostic journey for patients and providers and by facilitating appropriate referrals and lessening primary care provider burden for supporting post-diagnosis care. Additionally, a brain health care navigator in primary care could help to ensure access to dementia treatments and care management for the right patients at the right time.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/86", "#/texts/87", "#/texts/88", "#/texts/89", "#/texts/90", "#/texts/91", "#/texts/92", "#/texts/93", "#/texts/94", "#/texts/95", "#/texts/96", "#/texts/97", "#/texts/98", "#/texts/99", "#/texts/100", "#/texts/101", "#/texts/102", "#/texts/103", "#/texts/104", "#/texts/105"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "7f2b2157-5255-4052-a946-d53320c1cc30"}

In the Phase 3 clinical trial for lecanemab, approximately 62% of treated individuals had Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) [\n22\n]. Therefore, it has been suggested that the ideal candidates for anti-amyloid drugs are individuals who are able to perform activities of daily life without assistance and may appear cognitively normal during casual encounters, including with physicians at routine office visits. Timely diagnosis of and consultation for patients who are optimal for treatment is low [\n20\n]. The majority of new AD treatments are intended for early symptomatic and MCI stages, indicating a clear trend in the future direction of AD management toward early detection and intervention. This further highlights the need for improving and enhancing primary care pathways for detection and patient care.\nBiomarkers for diagnosing AD are becoming more important in the context of AD care and treatment. Prevention studies are treating individuals who have biomarker evidence of disease even before cognitive changes become apparent which some postulate may be the ideal time to treat AD [\n23\n,\n24\n]. Blood-based biomarkers are increasingly available, and future diagnostic pathways will likely be facilitated by primary care, creating the need for primary care-based shared decision-making, patient education, and counseling based on biomarker testing and other results [\n25\n].\nAdding the volume and complexity of these tasks to primary care practices is challenging. In the U.S. healthcare system, identified gaps exist in primary care provider (PCP) knowledge and comfort with diagnosing cognitive impairment, primary care-based management of dementia and related conditions, and PCPs' belief in the effectiveness of therapeutic options [\n26\n,\n27\n,\n28\n] Health system structures including insufficient time, inadequate support resources, and lack of reimbursable billing options are cited as significant additional constraints by PCPs [\n29\n]. Collaborative models of dementia care have been explored, developed, and validated over the years to address and overcome barriers, providing system approaches that have improved care where these models are feasible [\n30\n,\n31\n,\n32\n].", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/106", "#/texts/107", "#/texts/108", "#/texts/109", "#/texts/110", "#/texts/111", "#/texts/112", "#/texts/113", "#/texts/114", "#/texts/115", "#/texts/116", "#/texts/117", "#/texts/118", "#/texts/119", "#/texts/120", "#/texts/121", "#/texts/122", "#/texts/123", "#/texts/124", "#/texts/125", "#/texts/126", "#/texts/127", "#/texts/128", "#/texts/129", "#/texts/130", "#/texts/131", "#/texts/132"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "e2b0514a-b011-49b3-afd4-73a19cd92b4e"}

Recruitment for brain health research from primary care practices has been identified as a potential opportunity [\n33\n] particularly since older adults seeking primary care tend to be representative of the community [\n34\n]. However, lack of connections between primary care practices and AD research opportunities has historically been a barrier to leveraging this potential [\n35\n].\nGiven the numerous challenges facing patients experiencing cognitive decline and PCPs diagnosing dementia, we developed and implemented a patient care nurse (registered nurse) navigator-the Brain Health Navigator (BHN)-as support for the primary care team in the management of care for persons following an abnormal screening test. The role of the BHN was designed to assess cognitive impairment, facilitate the characterization of potential addressable causes, connect patients and their caregivers with community and research resources, and streamline entry to the clinical treatment pathway when needed.

During the BHN visit, they reviewed the patients' DCA results with them and answered their questions about the test results. Additional data collection at the visit included a Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) [\n40\n] to further characterize the patient's cognitive status. The BHN evaluated addressable causes of cognitive impairment using a variety of structured assessment tools. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) [\n41\n] and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) [\n42\n] were used to assess depression and anxiety. Vascular risk was assessed with the Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease risk score (ASCVD) [\n43\n].

Following the visit, the BHN reviewed the patient's EHR again and proposed additional laboratory tests or brain imaging to the PCP based on the assessed findings from the evaluation for addressable causes.

We believe this model could have an important impact on early identification of patients with cognitive impairment and streamline referral and treatment pathways, which will contribute to better health outcomes, improve healthcare utilization, and reduce burden on PCPs.\nAs a member of the primary care team, the BHN provides more comprehensive assessments, connection to resources, and care navigation for patients with cognitive concerns and borderline or likely impaired cognitive screening results. By executing more comprehensive initial cognitive assessments, by reviewing all prescription and over-the-counter medications/supplements, and evaluating for addressable co-morbid medical and mental health conditions, the BHN helps identify contributing or alternate causes for cognitive impairment. For appropriate patients, the BHN proposes additional workup to the primary care providers, such as brain imaging to assess for vascular burden and atrophy patterns, laboratory workup, and in appropriate cases, biomarker assessments using blood-based biomarkers, allowing the PCP to have oversight of the care process, but reducing the direct burden of that process on the PCP. Referrals to both neurology and neuropsychology being significantly more common in patients who saw the BHN suggests enhanced follow-up care and monitoring in the BHN group. In addition, the BHN can focus on the detailed assessment of cognitive-related conditions and testing, allowing the PCP to continue to address and manage other concurrent conditions.\nThus, in this analysis, engaging with the BHN led to statistically significant improvements in care for patients. These findings are important because they address important gaps in the current rates of diagnosis and follow-up care of patients with MCI and dementia [\n48\n]. The BHN role parallels other nurse navigators in primary care, particularly those helping to manage chronic medical conditions, where the appropriate information and support significantly impact patient care [\n49\n].", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/256", "#/texts/257", "#/texts/258", "#/texts/259", "#/texts/260", "#/texts/261", "#/texts/262"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "5f51dccf-5bbe-4fab-8644-6133a0e83fd6"}

Since the end of the study period, we have evolved the BHN workflow with a goal to improve patient navigation so that the most appropriate patients are referred to the most appropriate specialists or enhanced care pathway for their level of impairment and/or care needs. Thus, we believe the BHN role continues to hold promise for more appropriate referrals and partially mitigate exacerbation of the bottlenecks in specialty referrals.\nAt the time of the initiation of this study, no Federal Drug Administration (FDA)-approved disease-modifying treatments for AD was widely available. Therefore, when designing the BHN role and their triage function, patients suspected of having AD were referred to neurology, while those with significant vascular risk and comorbidities were referred to geriatrics or, if the patient preferred, back to primary care. Our updated practice allows the BHN to determine if a patient may be eligible for disease-modifying treatments (based on an agreed-upon checklist) and to refer them directly to a neurology treatment nurse coordinator instead of to the neurology referral pool, which further expedites patients' access to disease-modifying medications. The BHN's close collaboration with the neurology treatment team enhances the pathway process, as the BHN is familiar with treatment requirements, including contraindicated medications and relevant medical conditions.\nWhile we were unable to measure the appointment lag of referrals in this study due to the limited follow up period, we believe that the BHN's involvement can accelerate the diagnostic process, as BHN visits are available much sooner than traditional PCP referrals to neurology and geriatrics in our system. Subsequently, the warm hand off to the neurology treatment team for patients who had been thoroughly assessed by the BHN, are interested in treatment evaluation, and meet key treatment inclusion and exclusion criteria, allow patients to have faster evaluation of their appropriateness for disease modifying therapies.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/264", "#/texts/265", "#/texts/266"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "308f8849-f212-4b89-9e06-d4371ccc12dc"}

In appropriate patients, the BHN also follows up on imaging results and may potentially suggest screening or definitive biomarker assessments. The embedded blood-based biomarker pilot research study holds promise for the feasibility of the BHN offering blood-based biomarker tests and interpretation as part of the cognitive impairment assessment. In our model, the BHN disclosed biomarker results to patients and families with careful consideration, following extensive training on the nuances and the potential psychological impact of these discussions. Our finding that patients who saw the BHN were more likely to have a blood-based biomarker performed indicates that the BHN may play an important role in facilitating the use of blood-based biomarkers in primary care. More research is needed in this area.\nWe found that primary care patients at an older age were more likely statistically to have likely impaired DCA screening results, suggesting that routine longitudinal primary care-based screening may be helpful in identifying MCI earlier than in current healthcare systems models.

Advance care planning discussions like the ones initiated by the BHN at an early stage have been shown to improve outcomes in patients and families living with dementia, ultimately leading to improved patient autonomy in decision-making and reductions in healthcare utilization [\n51\n].\nIn our study, the large clinic with standardized screening practices and rule-based referrals had the greatest number of patients screened and referred to the BHN. This clinic had the highest rates of barriers to social determinants of health, suggesting that clinic factors could have contributed to the trend toward significance of ADI for those screened as likely cognitively impaired. However, previous literature has demonstrated higher rates of abnormal cognitive assessments in patients with low socioeconomic status [\n52\n]. Furthermore, in our study, the trend toward significance of the ADI with those who screened likely cognitively impaired demonstrates the importance of community resource referral as a key function for the BHN. These factors highlight the need for further research on the role of primary care in addressing health disparities of early detection and treatment.\nWe demonstrated that over 40% of patients with borderline impairment or likely cognitive impairment were willing to accept a referral for research, including 46% of Black or African American patients who saw the BHN. This finding supports previous literature suggesting that primary care-based recruitment for AD clinical trials has potential to enhance clinical trial diversity and that when given the opportunity to participate equitably, disparities in AD research participation may be significantly reduced.\nAlthough a relatively small number of people participated in a research sub-study to collect blood-based biomarkers, a significantly higher percentage of patients volunteered to consent when they interacted with the BHN.

Additionally, it demonstrates the BHN role as successful in connecting patients with opportunities that are appropriate to their individual health and goals, as well as connecting historically fragmented pieces of the AD research community. Primary care's contributions to AD team science hold the promise of yielding greater societal benefits.\n\nAn innovative health systems approach to support early detection of cognitive impairment in primary care - the brain health navigator\nDISCUSSION\nBilling and revenue\nAlthough the BHN model confers a cost to the healthcare system, its potential benefits in reducing the burden of other healthcare providers and accelerating patient triage and workup are critical in managing patients who may be candidates for disease-modifying therapies. While financial data on the cost of the BHN is not clearly understood, BHN billing may be possible using appropriate documentation. The Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) Evaluation and Management billing code 99211 can be used for billing outpatient nurse encounters, but the services provided by the BHN far exceed the typical services provided under this billing code. However, in our clinic with the current infrastructure, the services provided by the BHN meet the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services Chronic Care Management service requirements [\n53\n]. These more comprehensive codes better account for the services provided by the BHN particularly in patients who require multiple encounters for diagnostics, connection with community-based services, and workup for disease modifying treatments. Although these codes are unlikely able to fully fund the service, they can offset cost substantially depending on patient volumes. Further policy-based recognition of this role and additional funding mechanisms could support broader implementation. Anecdotal feedback from BHN nurses within our healthcare system has been overwhelmingly positive, with high job-satisfaction, which is consistent with other primary care-based nurse navigation models [\n19\n].", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/280", "#/texts/282", "#/texts/283", "#/texts/284", "#/texts/285", "#/texts/286"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "693633aa-76cf-41bf-8f03-69dc88536ce5"}

In this study, the BHN was only able to conduct a visit with 22.8% of referred patients. This was partially due to the delays in establishing the role and development of the approach. The majority of patients did not respond to the BHN contacts, with a maximum of three attempts made per subject. Approximately one-third of patients declined the BHN visit. Patient refusal to see the BHN may result from stigma related to concerns over brain health or denial of symptoms, and discerning these two is an aim for future research. It is worth noting that the BHN role was not established and implemented at the same time as the DCA screening in primary care, leading to substantial gaps in the lag time from DCA screening to BHN outreach and appointments for some patients.\nWe evaluated two factors retrospectively to better understand the low BHN completion rate: the type of referral and timing to first contact. We found that patients who were individually referred by their PCP were more likely to complete a BHN appointment. This suggests that providers likely conveyed their perceived value of the BHN referral during their encounter with the patient. Our opinion is that more immediate emphasis on BHN follow-up by the provider and timeliness of the referral to the BHN after DCA screening may play a role in the rate at which patients see the BHN. We hypothesize that more rapid contact by the BHN would lower rates of patients declining to see the BHN [\n54\n]. While our data analysis did not show significance in a retrospective analysis, further research on this factor is warranted, as this type of practice leads to better visit adherence in the experience of the authors and in previously published work [\n55\n].

The BHN role leads to higher completion of appropriate medical evaluation of addressable causes of cognitive impairment, which can include blood biomarkers, and more frequent assignment of a diagnosis, enhancing the success of early diagnosis to treatment clinical pathways.
