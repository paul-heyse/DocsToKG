Conversely, the concurrency of cognitive and olfactory impairments is expected to represent an advanced stage, associated with shorter time to diagnosis. Limited research has examined the association of isolated and concurrent cognitive and olfactory impairments with incident dementia. We aimed to estimate the 12-year dementia hazard for cognitive impairment no dementia (CIND), olfactory dysfunction (OD), and their combination in a population-based cohort of older adults. We classified 2406 participants from the Swedish National Study on Aging and Care in Kungsholmen (SNAC-K) based on baseline CIND and OD. Dementia hazard was estimated with Cox regressions for the whole period and two timeframes (baseline to 6-year follow-up and 6- to 12-year follow-up), and time until receiving a diagnosis via Laplace regressions. CIND+OD was associated with increased hazard ratio (HR) of dementia over 6 years (HR 11.38; 95% CI 6.70, 19.32;\np\np\np\np\np", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/1", "#/texts/2", "#/texts/3", "#/texts/4", "#/texts/5", "#/texts/6", "#/texts/7", "#/texts/8", "#/texts/9", "#/texts/10", "#/texts/11", "#/texts/12", "#/texts/14", "#/texts/15", "#/texts/16", "#/texts/17", "#/texts/18", "#/texts/19", "#/texts/20", "#/texts/21", "#/texts/22", "#/texts/23", "#/texts/24", "#/texts/25", "#/texts/26", "#/texts/27", "#/texts/28", "#/texts/29", "#/texts/30", "#/texts/31", "#/texts/32", "#/texts/33", "#/texts/34", "#/texts/35", "#/texts/36", "#/texts/37", "#/texts/38", "#/texts/39", "#/texts/41", "#/texts/42", "#/texts/44", "#/texts/46", "#/texts/48", "#/texts/50"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "7b02d89f-f96a-4fbe-b2c5-20764960e5dc"}

Olfactory dysfunction (OD) has emerged as an early dementia sign [\n2\n,\n3\n,\n4\n]. However, several questions remain regarding the interplay between olfactory and other predementia markers.\nOlfactory markers have been postulated to stratify individuals at different risk levels for dementia. In previous studies, a worse odor identification (OID) ability predicted progression from cognitive impairment (CI) to AD dementia in older adults [\n5\n]. Furthermore, better OID was associated with a reduced likelihood of transition from CI to all-type dementia and with cognitive maintenance in cognitively unimpaired individuals [\n6\n,\n7\n,\n8\n]. More recently, combining cognitive screening and OID tests has shown to be comparable to amyloid PET scans in estimating progression to CI or dementia [\n9\n].\nThese findings suggest that olfactory assessment could be a simple and cost-efficient tool for monitoring patients in primary care, identifying those at higher risk of dementia for referral to memory clinics, and selecting participants for clinical trials. However, there is a research gap in exploring the association of isolated and concurrent cognitive and olfactory impairments with future dementia. In this regard, an early study showed that older individuals with CI and OD showed an almost two-fold increased risk of progression to all-type dementia over 3.5 years compared to individuals with only CI [\n10\n]. Moreover, it has been hypothesized that olfactory deficits may appear early in the dementia course preceding memory deterioration and CI [\n2\n]. Considering the suggested sequence of pre-dementia events for cognitive and olfactory impairments, one could hypothesize that their concurrency would be related to incipient dementia in the short term, whereas presenting OD alone would be an early pre-dementia marker.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/75", "#/texts/76", "#/texts/77", "#/texts/78", "#/texts/79", "#/texts/80", "#/texts/81", "#/texts/82", "#/texts/83", "#/texts/84", "#/texts/85", "#/texts/86", "#/texts/87", "#/texts/88", "#/texts/89", "#/texts/90", "#/texts/91", "#/texts/92", "#/texts/93", "#/texts/94", "#/texts/95", "#/texts/96", "#/texts/97", "#/texts/98", "#/texts/99"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "f3b8c8e5-ad18-45ae-8987-b3c62866b286"}

After their presentation, the participants had 2 min for free oral recall. The free recall score, computed as the number of correctly recalled words, was used for CIND classification.\nExecutive function: The executive function task was the trail making test-B (TMT-B), which required participants to connect 13 encircled digits and letters in an alternating numerical and alphabetical order (1-A, 2-B, 3-C, etc.) [\n13\n]. The TMT-B score was computed as the number of correct connections.\nLanguage: Language tasks consisted of two letter fluency (F and A) and two category fluency (animals and professions) tasks [\n13\n]. Participants were given 60 s to orally generate as many words as possible. The scores consisted of the number of words generated in one minute for each one of the tasks.\nVisuospatial abilities: The visuospatial abilities task consisted of a 10-item version of the Shepherd-Metzler mental rotation test [\n14\n,\n15\n]. In each item, the participant should decide, within 45 s, which one of the three rotated figures presented matched a target figure. The score was computed as the number of correctly selected figures.\nPerceptual speed: The perceptual speed tasks consisted of two paper-and-pencil tests. In digit cancellation, 11 rows of random digits ranging from 1 to 9 were presented and the participants should inspect the rows sequentially and cross out every digit 4 they detected [\n16\n]. In pattern comparison, the participants should sequentially judge and mark accordingly if 30 different pairs of line-segment patterns presented in two different sheets (15 pairs per sheet) were \"same\" or \"different\" [\n17\n].

The results suggest that this combination is associated with a higher progression to dementia within the next few years, and the association was even more pronounced in individuals with amnestic CI. Individuals with either isolated cognitive or olfactory impairments displayed a comparable elevated dementia risk over the first 6 years after examination, whereas individuals with isolated smell impairment displayed a reliably higher dementia hazard across the whole 12-year follow-up interval.\nIsolated CI was associated with a higher hazard of dementia, which was most pronounced within the first 6 years and in individuals with the amnestic form. Participants with isolated CI displayed 9.5% dementia progression over the whole period, while those with combined cognitive and olfactory impairments displayed 30% dementia progression. These observations align with previous studies suggesting that the presence of objective CI may be insufficient to capture the complexity of predementia stages [\n33\n]. Other markers, such as olfactory deficits, could enhance the identification of specific groups with a higher likelihood of dementia progression.\nHaving isolated OD was associated with a more than two times increased hazard of dementia over 12 years. Importantly, this association remained stable in the period closest and furthest to baseline. This finding is in line with previous population-based studies, showing that the worse olfactory performance is associated with future dementia [\n3\n,\n4\n,\n5\n,\n34\n,\n35\n]. Notably, we observed this relationship in a group of individuals classified as cognitively unimpaired using a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment, whereas prior reports applied shorter cognitive screening tests to exclude CI at baseline [\n3\n,\n4\n,\n34\n]. The detected relation between isolated OD and incident dementia over 12 years reinforces its status as an early predementia marker, highlighting its independence of displaying concurrent CI. This finding is especially relevant since a crucial issue is that once objective CI is evident, the disease progression is already quite far gone for those where the cognitive symptoms are due to AD [\n1\n].", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/305", "#/texts/306", "#/texts/307", "#/texts/308", "#/texts/309", "#/texts/310", "#/texts/311", "#/texts/312", "#/texts/313", "#/texts/314", "#/texts/315", "#/texts/316", "#/texts/317", "#/texts/318", "#/texts/319", "#/texts/320", "#/texts/321", "#/texts/322", "#/texts/323", "#/texts/324", "#/texts/325", "#/texts/326", "#/texts/327"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "2ad66cd6-4b30-4e29-8e52-8fd779e42831"}

After splitting the time to incident dementia, the relationship was more pronounced within the first 6 years from baseline examination. Our findings align with prior reports of increased dementia progression for the concurrence of cognitive and olfactory impairments over shorter follow-ups in clinical and population-based settings [\n10\n,\n36\n]. Although, in the multi-adjusted model, their concurrency was significantly associated with a higher hazard of dementia between 6- and 12-year follow-ups, it remained at the same level of isolated OD and was no longer significant after considering death as a competing risk event. Thus, we expand previous knowledge by circumscribing their incremented joint predictive value to a short term.\nNext, we explored the potential modifying effects of\nAPOE\n\u03b54 status, age, and sex. We found that for those individuals with isolated OD, the young-old group showed a higher hazard of dementia over 12 years than the old-old. This finding strengthens the notion that special attention should be given to olfactory deficits at younger old age [\n3\n].\nThe hazard associated with CI subtypes was higher for those having the memory domain affected, especially in combination with OD. When having OD, amnestic individuals had more than a doubled risk of developing dementia than those with non-amnestic impairment. The association was more pronounced within the first 6 years after baseline, reaching a 22.2-fold increased risk for amnestic CI with OD, nearly three times higher than for those with memory preserved. Our findings are consistent with previous studies reporting a higher progression to dementia in amnestic CI with olfactory deficits in population-based and clinical settings [\n10\n,\n37\n].\nCognitive and olfactory impairments are also associated with decreased survival [\n38\n,\n39\n,\n40\n].

Olfactory deficits have been suggested to precede cognitive decline and impairment [\n2\n], which is supported by evidence from population-based and community-based studies [\n10\n,\n41\n,\n42\n,\n43\n,\n44\n]. These functional changes are expected to accompany pathological events in the brain, characterized by amyloid deposition and tau formation in olfactory-related brain areas, potentially leading to neurodegeneration [\n2\n]. In this context, one could argue that isolated OD would be a long-standing predictor of dementia, while once CI concurs, it predicts dementia in the short term. In our cohort, it could be expected that those classified as isolated OD later developed CI as an intermediate predementia stage [\n8\n]. We found that having CI with OD accelerated the onset of dementia by 3 years compared to their isolated forms.\nOverall, our findings are in line with the hypothesis of olfactory-first impairment in predementia stages. In addition, they highlight its relevance as an indicator of more imminent dementia progression when accompanied by CI. Further studies should address whether combining cognitive and olfactory trajectories improves dementia detection, as previous single-modality studies suggested [\n18\n,\n43\n]. They should also investigate alternative pathways not accompanied by olfactory deficits, as suggested, for example, by our results showing that isolated CI is still related to future dementia. This approach could help protect against false positives. In this sense, better OID performance has been previously associated with a higher likelihood of transition from CI back to normal [\n8\n].\nThe main strength of this study is that it includes a combination of a broad neuropsychological assessment and OID testing in a large sample with a long follow-up interval involving thorough dementia assessment. The main limitation is that due to the clinical nature of dementia diagnosis, we could not perform split analyses by dementia subtypes. Moreover, the generalizability could be limited because of the participants' profile (relativity healthy and fit, predominantly high socioeconomic standing, and mainly Swedish-born).", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/350", "#/texts/351", "#/texts/352", "#/texts/353", "#/texts/354", "#/texts/355", "#/texts/356", "#/texts/357", "#/texts/358", "#/texts/359", "#/texts/360", "#/texts/361", "#/texts/362", "#/texts/363", "#/texts/364", "#/texts/365", "#/texts/366", "#/texts/367", "#/texts/368", "#/texts/369", "#/texts/370", "#/texts/371", "#/texts/372", "#/texts/373", "#/texts/374"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "77e1bb8c-6716-41f6-b7ea-a7ff445b21ff"}

Although the observed data and statistical findings reinforce the potential role of OID tasks in identifying amnestic cognitively impaired individuals at a higher short-term risk of dementia, interpretations should be cautious. Future multi-sample studies could help overcome this limitation.\nOID performance relies in part on declarative memory processes [\n45\n,\n46\n], raising the possibility that the observed olfactory impairment in individuals with aCIND reflects, at least partially, underlying deficits in verbal and semantic memory. This overlap is important to consider when interpreting the results in this group. However, our findings support the role of OD as a distinct early marker of dementia and clearly demonstrate the added value of assessing olfactory impairment in addition to memory impairment for detecting individuals with a high risk of progressing to dementia in the short term. Further studies are warranted to quantify shared and unique contributions of olfactory and memory deficits in dementia risk.\nThis study demonstrates the added advantage of combining cognitive and olfactory testing to identify people with increased dementia risk. The results suggest that CI accompanied by OD is a signal of incipient dementia in the coming years, especially for those with the memory domain affected. Furthermore, our findings reaffirm the robustness of OD as a long-standing early marker of dementia on its own. Our results support the notion that including an OID test in predementia screening could be a cost-efficient approach for early dementia detection in clinical settings and selection of participants for clinical trials.\n\nOlfactory dysfunction increases progression to dementia in cognitively impaired older adults: a 12-year population-based study\nData availability\nData can be made available on reasonable request and approval by the SNAC-K data management and maintenance committee (snac-k.se).", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/375", "#/texts/376", "#/texts/377", "#/texts/378", "#/texts/379", "#/texts/380", "#/texts/381", "#/texts/383"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "a5d9f3ef-7c96-4456-b539-23441e37d21d"}
