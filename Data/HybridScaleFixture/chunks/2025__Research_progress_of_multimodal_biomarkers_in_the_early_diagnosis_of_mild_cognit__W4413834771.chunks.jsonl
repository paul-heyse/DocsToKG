Relevant epidemiological research shows that over 80% of PD patients have cognitive function changes, and approximately 30% of them will eventually develop into PDD (\n1\n). Between 20 and 33% of patients have PD-MCI at the time of diagnosis of PD, and as many as 57% of PD patients develop PD-MCI successively within 5 years after the first diagnosis (\n2\n,\n3\n). In recent years, with the rapid development of big data, artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies, the application of multimodal biomarkers has increasingly gained favor in clinical research, providing powerful tools for the early diagnosis and prognosis of diseases. By aggregating and integrating multi-dimensional data such as neuroimaging, humoral biomarkers, genetics, digital phenotypes, and clinical assessment tools, the pathophysiological changes of PD-MCI can be reflected from different perspectives, providing support for conducting high-quality clinical research and precise diagnosis and treatment. The realization of precise identification of risk factors for PD-MCI, early intervention of the disease and improvement of prognosis provides evidence-based medical evidence, which is conducive to the formulation of effective prevention and treatment strategies in clinical practice. This article reviews the application of multimodal biomarkers in the diagnosis of PD-MCI, explores their different roles in clinical diagnosis, and looks forward to their potential value in the assessment of PD-MCI, aiming to provide a more comprehensive diagnostic strategy for clinical practice and offer references for future research directions (\nFigure 1\n).\nFigure 1\nFigure 1\n.

Through imaging techniques such as Structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (sMRI), Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT), and Positron Emission Tomography (PET), researchers can identify structural and functional changes associated with PD-MCI. For instance, MRI can reveal atrophy in brain regions related to motor control, while PET is used to detect changes in dopamine transporter activity in the brain. These imaging biomarkers are not only helpful for early diagnosis but also provide key evidence for monitoring disease progression.

Changes in these parameters are closely related to dysfunction in specific cognitive domains, as reflected by abnormal striatal volume alterations in PD-MCI patients. A multicenter study found that cortical thickness in the frontal lobe (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, DLPFC) and parietal lobe (inferior parietal cortex) of PD-MCI patients was significantly reduced compared to healthy controls, with the degree of atrophy positively correlating with declines in executive function (e.g., Stroop test) and working memory scores (\n5\n). A longitudinal cohort study showed that volume reduction in the temporal lobe (parahippocampal gyrus, entorhinal cortex) independently predicts episodic memory impairment in PD-MCI patients, with an atrophy rate 1.5 times faster than in PD patients without cognitive impairment (\n6\n). Compared to early PD patients without MCI, the PD-MCI group exhibited more pronounced white matter microstructural abnormalities. sMRI evidence indicated widespread reductions in white matter fiber tract integrity, along with significantly increased volumes of white matter hyperintensity lesions in periventricular and deep brain regions. Moreover, expansion of white matter hyperintensities in the left frontal and temporal lobes was significantly associated with worsening performance on free recall tests, suggesting that white matter damage in specific brain regions may underlie PD-MCI pathology (\n7\n-\n10\n).", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/270", "#/texts/271", "#/texts/272", "#/texts/273", "#/texts/274", "#/texts/275", "#/texts/276", "#/texts/277", "#/texts/278"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "65a5f03a-dfaf-4fca-a210-12bbe188e752"}

Compared to controls, PD-MCI patients show markedly reduced bilateral prefrontal cortex intra-FC, characterized by decreased connectivity strength between the caudate nucleus and precuneus (\n12\n). Besides widespread FC reduction, studies have reported abnormal increases in FC between the midbrain-posterior cingulate cortex and left hippocampus-right cerebellar hemisphere in PD-MCI patients (\n13\n,\n14\n). Apart from FC, local consistency (ReHo) values within the DMN positively correlate with cognitive function in PD and continuously decline with disease progression (\n15\n). The dynamic FC changes in the DMN, frontoparietal network (FPN), and salience network are more sensitive than structural imaging, with continuous alterations in the salience network showing the strongest association with PD cognitive impairment (PD-CI).

A multicenter study showed that DAT binding in the caudate and posterior putamen of PD-MCI patients was 30-40% lower than that of healthy controls, with caudate DAT loss significantly correlated with executive functions (such as Stroop test) and working memory (such as digit span test) scores (\n18\n). The B\u00e4ckman research team, through longitudinal DAT-SPECT tracking, found that PD patients with an annual striatal DAT binding decline rate exceeding 5% had a 3.2-fold increased risk of progression to MCI within 3 years, indicating that DAT loss could serve as an early predictive biomarker of cognitive decline (\n19\n). Serotonin (5-HT) positron emission tomography (PET) utilizes tracers (e.g., [11C] DASB, [18F]altanserin) to visualize serotonin transporter (SERT) or receptor distribution, revealing abnormalities in the raphe 5-HT system and its association with attention and emotional regulation deficits in PD-MCI. Studies show that compared to healthy controls, PD-MCI patients exhibit a 45% decrease in raphe SERT binding, which is positively correlated with Conners' Continuous Performance Test (CPT) scores. Reduced 5-HT projections from the raphe to the prefrontal cortex may impair attentional control (\n20\n).

Tau positron emission tomography (Tau-PET), employing specific tracers such as [18F]AV-1451 and [18F]MK-6240, visualizes tau protein deposits, illustrating the spatial characteristics of tau pathology in PD-MCI and their relationship to cognitive decline. Sch\u00f6ll et al. found that tau deposition in the midbrain positively correlates with dopaminergic neuron loss assessed by DaT-SPECT, suggesting the involvement of tau pathology in degeneration of the nigrostriatal pathway (\n24\n).

Due to their diversity and sensitivity, biochemical biomarkers hold broad application potential in clinical practice. Research on biomarkers continues to advance, and novel biomarkers, such as changes in \u03b1 -synuclein and tau protein, have been confirmed to be associated with PD-MCI, offering new avenues for early clinical diagnosis (\n27\n).", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/316", "#/texts/317", "#/texts/318", "#/texts/319", "#/texts/320"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "cda82b26-d8a2-479a-a6e2-b2d0a87a675e"}

Numerous studies have shown that total \u03b1 -synuclein levels in the CSF of PD-MCI patients are significantly lower than those in healthy controls and PD patients without cognitive impairment. Kang et al. found that decreased CSF \u03b1 -synuclein levels in PD-MCI patients are related to midbrain atrophy and weakened functional connectivity of the default mode network (DMN), suggesting it may serve as a surrogate marker for neuronal loss (\n28\n).

(3) Insufficient allocation of interdisciplinary research resources has restricted the efficiency of large-scale cohort validation and technology transfer. Multimodal biomarkers still need to be further optimized and validated through clinical tests. Future research directions include: improving data quality on the basis of multimodal data fusion, constructing more generalized integrated models based on neurophysiological and pathological mechanisms, building larger-scale multi-center standardized databases, and promoting clinical transformation and precision diagnosis and treatment through industry-university-research collaboration.
