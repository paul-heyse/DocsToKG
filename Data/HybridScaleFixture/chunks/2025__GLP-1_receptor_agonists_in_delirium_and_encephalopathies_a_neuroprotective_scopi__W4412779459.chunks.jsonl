Delirium is a neurological syndrome characterized by an acute change in mental status with a fluctuating course, inattention, and disorganized thinking [\n3\n]. On the other hand, encephalopathy is a broad term representing a global brain disorder that can manifest as delirium, subsyndromal delirium, or even coma, depending on the severity of the underlying brain dysfunction [\n4\n,\n5\n].\nEncephalopathy and delirium are frequently observed in critically ill and elderly patients. These neurological conditions lead to poorer outcomes, including increased mortality rates, long-term cognitive impairment, and dementia [\n6\n,\n7\n,\n8\n]. These conditions often result in hospitalization, and because of their association with an increased risk of cognitive impairment, patients may require extra care or transition to long-term care facilities [\n9\n,\n10\n]. Given this background, prompt diagnosis and management are critical for improving patient outcomes [\n11\n,\n12\n].\nThe management of encephalopathy and delirium share similar principles. These include identifying and treating the underlying cause, such as infections, correcting metabolic issues, emphasizing supportive care, and promoting cerebral perfusion [\n13\n,\n14\n]. In delirium, pharmacological management, including the use of antipsychotics or dexmedetomidine, focuses on controlling agitation but may overlook the complex neurochemical pathways involved [\n15\n]. Similarly, in encephalopathy, no direct therapies targeting the neurochemical and neurotransmitter pathways are currently available [\n13\n]. Emerging research suggests that glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) may offer neuroprotective benefits, particularly in neurodegenerative diseases [\n16\n].", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/65", "#/texts/66", "#/texts/67", "#/texts/68", "#/texts/69", "#/texts/70", "#/texts/71", "#/texts/72", "#/texts/73", "#/texts/74", "#/texts/75", "#/texts/76", "#/texts/77", "#/texts/78", "#/texts/79", "#/texts/80", "#/texts/81", "#/texts/82", "#/texts/83", "#/texts/84", "#/texts/85", "#/texts/86", "#/texts/87", "#/texts/88", "#/texts/89", "#/texts/90", "#/texts/91", "#/texts/92", "#/texts/93", "#/texts/94", "#/texts/95", "#/texts/96", "#/texts/97", "#/texts/98", "#/texts/99", "#/texts/100", "#/texts/101"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "0d49699e-4a60-432d-8e6c-0da14f2e53dc"}

Activation of GLP-1 receptors in the brain regions essential for cognition and memory, such as the hippocampus, cortex, and amygdala, offers neuroprotection in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., reducing neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis) [\n19\n]. Furthermore, GLP-1 RAs have become a promising therapy for managing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity [\n20\n,\n21\n]. At the molecular level, it emulates the function of the natural incretin hormone GLP-1, which is essential for regulating glucose metabolism and energy balance [\n22\n]. Moreover, GLP-1 RAs offer weight loss, reduced blood pressure, and potential cardiovascular benefits beyond glycemic control [\n23\n]. Indeed, the first GLP-1 RA (i.e., Exenatide or Ex-4) was approved by the FDA in 2005 for T2DM treatment [\n24\n]. Since then, several GLP-1 RAs drugs have become available, including Liraglutide, Semaglutide, and Dulaglutide [\n25\n,\n26\n].\nWhile recent studies have demonstrated the possible neuroprotective effects of GLP-1 RAs in neurodegenerative conditions, such as Alzheimer's dementia, there is a lack of literature reviews on their benefits in the highly neurodegenerative-related condition of delirium [\n17\n,\n18\n].

Among elderly patients admitted for surgery, the incidence of postoperative delirium can reach 15-53% [\n28\n]. Unfortunately, postoperative delirium poses a significant risk of adverse consequences, including increased morbidity, mortality, extended length of hospital stay, and cognitive decline [\n28\n,\n29\n]. GLP-1 RAs, owing to their potential neuroprotective effects in neurodegenerative disorders, may benefit the treatment and prevention of postoperative delirium[\n30\n].\nThe potential role of GLP-1 RAs in treating postoperative delirium has been reported in some animal studies. In aged mice undergoing cardiac surgery, delirium-like behaviors, such as anxiety and memory deficits, have been linked to A1 astrocyte activation in the hippocampus. This leads to microglial activation and glutamate accumulation, which can be mitigated by Liraglutide and Ex-4 [\n31\n,\n32\n]. Furthermore, Liraglutide reduced the heightened neuroinflammation and impaired neuronal health observed during surgery in aged mice. Neuroinflammation is eased by reduced microglial and NLRP3 inflammasome activation through the PINK1/Parkin pathway, whereas neuronal health is enhanced by increased mitophagy and synaptic plasticity[\n31\n]. In addition, Liraglutide prevents apoptosis by reducing oxidative stress and phosphorylation of tau proteins and neurofilaments in brain cells, supporting its potential neuroprotective effects [\n33\n,\n34\n].

Glucose metabolism is essential for preventing hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, particularly with GLP-1 RA, which can mitigate the risk of postoperative delirium [\n35\n,\n36\n]. However, it is important to weigh this benefit against the potential aspiration risk associated with administering GLP-1 RA during surgery [\n37\n]. In a triple-blind randomized controlled trial involving 261 patients with diabetes undergoing cardiac surgery, the mean blood sugar level was significantly lower in the Liraglutide group (6.3 mmol/L) than in the placebo group (7.0 mmol/L), with a 95% confidence interval of 0.39-0.93 (p\n38\n]. This demonstrates the complex relationship between glucose metabolism and delirium, where excessive glucose control may not necessarily translate into improved delirium outcomes [\n39\n].

Specifically, Liraglutide administration in septic mouse models decreased neuroinflammation by enhancing the hippocampal brain insulin pathway, lowering pro-inflammatory markers (e.g., TNF-\u03b1), and reducing glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta activity (GSK3B) levels. Subsequently, decreased neuroinflammation leads to enhanced synaptic plasticity [\n46\n]. The enhancement of insulin signaling and the reduction of GSK3\u03b2 activity contribute to improved cognitive function, as indicated by lower tau phosphorylation levels, a marker of neurodegeneration. In addition, Liraglutide treatment affects proteins crucial for synaptic plasticity, such as cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and AMPA receptors (types of glutamate receptors). In post-septic mice, reduced phosphorylated CREB and GluA1 levels (a subunit of AMPA receptors) impair memory and learning, and Liraglutide may restore these levels and improve cognitive function [\n46\n]. Conversely, neuronal degeneration is associated with microglial activation, which leads to programmed cell death, known as apoptosis, and immunologically mediated cell death, known as necroptosis [\n19\n]. In mouse models, treatment with Liraglutide decreased both necroptosis and apoptosis in hippocampal neurons, further supporting the neuroprotective effects of GLP-1 RAs [\n19\n,\n47\n]. A critical pathway involved in necroptosis during sepsis is the reduced activity of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) [\n48\n].

When this pathway is activated, autophagy diminishes. Intriguingly, GLP-1 RAs, such as Ex-4, enhance mTOR activity by reducing caspases-3 and -8 levels, which are key components of apoptosis. This modulation protects neurons from necroptotic cell death in models of neurodegenerative disorders [\n19\n].

Several pathophysiological mechanisms have been identified for the prevention of apoptosis, including the reduction of oxidative stress in postoperative delirium, diabetic encephalopathy, and hepatic encephalopathy. Additionally, the involvement of the mTOR pathway has been noted in septic and diabetic encephalopathy and the phosphorylation of tau proteins in diabetic and sepsis-associated encephalopathy and postoperative delirium. These anti-apoptotic benefits of GLP-1 RAs are not unique to delirium and encephalopathies, but have also been established in various biological systems, such as neuronal cells, cardiomyocytes, pancreatic beta cells, and cardiac progenitor cells[\n109\n,\n110\n,\n111\n,\n112\n]. This demonstrated the versatility of GLP-1 RAs in different biological systems, indicating a convergence of shared cellular protection mechanisms through the modulation of apoptotic pathways and other mechanisms that regulate cell death. While the review highlights promising preclinical evidence for GLP-1 RAs in preventing cell death in various encephalopathies, clinical evidence remains limited. Indeed, this review notes that evidence for apoptotic mechanisms is lacking in human studies on sepsis-associated encephalopathy, and most human studies on hepatic encephalopathy are observational in nature. Additionally, limited research on hypoxia-induced encephalopathy has primarily focused on post-cardiac patients, which may not be representative of the broader patient population.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/428", "#/texts/429", "#/texts/430", "#/texts/431", "#/texts/432", "#/texts/433", "#/texts/434", "#/texts/435", "#/texts/436"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "07adc8d4-82c9-4d98-b5d1-116ea3dc607e"}

Several pathophysiological mechanisms contribute to cognitive improvement, including the activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways. For instance, these mechanisms lead to a reduction in amyloid-beta plaques and modulation of NMDA receptors and glutamate toxicity, all of which promote neuronal health and enhance synaptic plasticity. Similarly, these findings have been translated into improved cognition in human studies. These cognitive-enhancing potentials, similarly implicated in animal models of Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and traumatic brain injury, suggest a broader applicability for GLP-1 RAs in neurological conditions marked by cognitive deficits [\n18\n,\n99\n].\nThis scoping review had several strengths. First, considering the prevalence and harmful cognitive and functional consequences of delirium and encephalopathy, this review offers a comprehensive overview, based on available preclinical and clinical evidence, of the promising role of GLP-1 RAs in brain functions. Second, it highlights potential molecular or pathophysiological mechanisms by illustrating a diagram (Fig.\n1\n) that shows how GLP-1 RAs may exert therapeutic effects in patients with these conditions.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/437", "#/texts/438", "#/texts/439", "#/texts/440", "#/texts/441", "#/texts/442", "#/texts/443", "#/texts/444"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "2daebe93-9ca9-4908-81df-0c6a6012f985"}

First, this review does not include other types of delirium and encephalopathies (e.g., delirium due to metabolic causes, encephalopathy from demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis, and seizure-associated encephalopathy). However, it provides a foundational overview of the benefits of GLP-1 RAs in relation to delirium and encephalopathies, laying the groundwork for future research. Second, this review was not a systematic review or meta-analysis; therefore, critical appraisal of each data was not performed, and the quality of evidence was not graded. However, systematic review and meta-analysis may not be appropriate or timely at this point, given the scarcity of human observational and randomized trials; thus, providing a scoping review is the best attempt or opportunity to present the current state of evidence. Third, this review represents brain dysfunction that mainly affects older adults or the elderly; thus, it may not be applicable to pediatric patients.

First, additional research is necessary to understand the effects of GLP-1 RAs on other types of encephalopathies and delirium, which are not covered in this review. Second, additional observational or randomized clinical trials are required to further investigate the efficacy and safety of GLP-1 RAs in preventing and treating delirium and encephalopathies. Third, the optimal dose, duration, and timing of GLP-1 RA treatment for delirium and encephalopathies should be determined. Fourth, comparative studies with other diabetic agents (e.g., insulin, SGLT-2i, and DPP-4i) must be undertaken to further elucidate the pharmacological properties and adverse effect profiles of GLP-1 RAs. Fifth, a systematic or meta-analysis review must be conducted to evaluate the therapeutic effects of GLP-1 RAs in encephalopathies and delirium once more observational or randomized studies are published. Sixth, the mechanisms underlying the exact roles of GLP-1 RAs in delirium and encephalopathies are complex. Therefore, further mechanistic studies are necessary to fully elucidate the intricate pathways through which GLP-1 RAs exert their neuroprotective effects, ultimately optimizing their clinical applications.

Both preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and cognitive enhancement properties. Anti-inflammatory properties are linked to a reduction in inflammatory markers, while anti-apoptotic benefits promote cellular health and synaptic plasticity. This cognitive-enhancing potential may delay cognitive impairment and functional decline in delirium and encephalopathies. Nevertheless, it is still necessary to understand the role of GLP-1 RAs in other types of encephalopathies and different causes of delirium. Further clinical trials are essential to evaluate the efficacy and safety of GLP-1 RAs, establish optimal dosing guidelines, and compare their effects with those of alternative treatments. Future studies should also investigate the mechanisms by which GLP-1 RAs deliver neuroprotective benefits, ultimately leading to improved clinical outcomes.\n\nGLP-1 receptor agonists in delirium and encephalopathies: a neuroprotective scoping review\nData availability\nNo datasets were generated or analysed during the current study.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/448", "#/texts/450"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "c52bfb73-da85-4937-b112-d89fab22ccfb"}
