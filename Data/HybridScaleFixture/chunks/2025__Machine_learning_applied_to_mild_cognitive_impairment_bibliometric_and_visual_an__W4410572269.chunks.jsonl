Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), an intermediate state between normal aging and dementia, is a syndrome of cognitive impairment. Early recognition and intervention of MCI have great value for delaying the decline of cognitive function and improving the quality of life in the elderly. Machine learning (ML) is the core sub-branch direction in the field of artificial intelligence. In recent years, evaluating the potential application of machine learning in medicine has been popular, including the field of mild cognitive impairment. However, there is currently no bibliometrics to evaluate the scientific advances in this field.\nObjective:\nThis study aims to visually analyze the current research trends regarding the application of machine learning in the field of MCI through bibliometry and visualization techniques.\nMethods:\nUsing the Web of Science Core Collection database (Wo SCC), relevant articles and reviews of the collection database 2015-2024.

At present, the global prevalence of MCI is about 6.8-32% (\n2\n-\n4\n). If the patient with mild cognitive impairment further deteriorates to the dementia stage, the patient has late loss of independent living, which will bring heavy economic burden to the society and family (\n5\n). Therefore, the focus on this stage has become a key entry point to delay the development of dementia.\nArtificial intelligence is a branch of computer science, and machine learning is an important research direction in the field of artificial intelligence research. As a data analysis tool, machine learning has the ability to extract and analyze a large number of different types of clinical data sets. In addition, machine learning is also applied to assist diagnosis, disease triage, disease risk prediction and rapid disease identification (\n6\n,\n7\n). In the field of mild cognitive impairment, machine learning technology is good at processing multimodal and high dimensional data, can be regarded as a reliable tool (\n8\n-\n13\n) for early differential diagnosis and prediction of disease progression of cognitive decline in the elderly, thus, machine learning plays a crucial role in the field.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/257", "#/texts/258", "#/texts/259", "#/texts/260", "#/texts/261", "#/texts/262", "#/texts/263", "#/texts/264", "#/texts/265", "#/texts/266", "#/texts/267", "#/texts/268", "#/texts/269", "#/texts/270", "#/texts/271", "#/texts/272", "#/texts/273", "#/texts/274"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "25d24523-e0b7-45d9-a910-2dd73ed2fc97"}

Therefore, it is indispensable for researchers to keep continuous attention to the latest literature in this field and a comprehensive timely update of information through dynamic visualization. Bibliometric analysis is a statistical method based on public literature databases, not only allowing the quantitative and qualitative evaluation of publications to help in the analysis of domain-specific research hotspots and trends (\n14\n), And bibliometrics can help decision-making and research manage (\n15\n) by providing new information. In recent years, the application of machine learning in cognitive impairment research developed rapidly, in addition to the lack of bibliometric analysis associated with mild cognitive impairment, it is noteworthy that the multidisciplinary nature of the field and its subject diversity prompted us to machine learning in mild cognitive impairment related literature to conduct a comprehensive macro analysis.

Each sector in (\nFigure 2A\n) represents a country, and the thickness of the string is usually proportional to the strength of the cooperation. The wider sectors in China and the United States may indicate that both countries have published or influential publications in the field of machine learning assistance in the treatment of MCI. As can be seen from the figure, the United States has extensive cooperative relations with many countries, especially with China, Canada and Germany. This suggests that the United States is a central hub in international research cooperation. In addition, China also works with many countries, especially Australia, South Korea and Japan, which shows that China is an important partner in the application of machine learning in the field of MCI research. European countries, such as the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, etc. have formed a relatively intensive cooperation network in the map, showing the activity of scientific research cooperation between European countries and with other countries. For example, Japan, South Korea, Singapore and other Asian countries have small sector areas, but they also show certain cooperation networks in the figure, and their contributions in the field of cognitive impairment cannot be ignored.

Although the number of articles has a small inflection point (2022-2023), which may be related to the internal policy adjustment, the number of articles in 2024 returns to an upward trend, exceeds the past number and can be continuously monitored later. The distribution of each country/region (\nFigures 2A\n,\nB\n) shows that China and the United States have major research relations in the global international cooperation and exchange, and most countries have certain exchanges, however, some countries are relatively low, and the development of MCI into dementia will cause huge medical and social burden. In the future, countries should continue to strengthen international academic exchanges, maintain exchanges in this field and work together to promote their positive development.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/487", "#/texts/488", "#/texts/489", "#/texts/490", "#/texts/491", "#/texts/492", "#/texts/493", "#/texts/494"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "32ab720e-2d36-42e2-ad79-6fc7b7546e5a"}

It is worth mentioning that the article \"Mini-mental state: A practical method for grading the cognitive state of patients for the clinician\" (\n38\n) by Folstein MF et al. in Psychiatric Research in 1975 is the most frequently cited article in the field. Based on the above data, the analysis shows that Jack, C. R, Petersen, R. C, Rhoda Au and Folstein MF, and their work has had a profound impact on the research in this field. To observe the evolution and development of MCI assessment methods or tools, we also included literature on early cognitive function screening tools related to the MCI theme. Ultimately, our research found that there is indeed a trend: in the early stages, these studies primarily focused on cognitive function screening tools for mild cognitive impairment, such as the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). These assessment tools had not yet incorporated machine learning algorithms, although the authors' influence was significant. However, over time, many researchers joined the MCI field, and with technological updates and iterations, the impact of MCI research has grown, and the research process has deepened. Eventually, the initial trend of using tools like \"MoCA\" and \"MMSE\" to assess individual cognitive function gradually evolved into a subfield of research where machine learning is widely applied to mild cognitive impairment (as shown in the subsequent figures).\nTable 6\nTable 6\n.

This interdisciplinary flow and shift helps to drive innovation and address complex problems.\nBy (\nFigures 7A\n,\nB\n) show the research theme and direction of machine learning in the emerging field of MCI. Machine learning performs well in the field of mild cognitive impairment and also shows many innovative advantages. Prediction model of mild cognitive impairment: Using different classical machine learning methods, learning to predict MCI when different types of neurocognitive metadata (\n47\n) are used as inputs. Machine learning can detect changes in brain structure and train the model to identify early signs of change. The emergence of novel cross-converter models (\n48\n) predicts MCI from speech, language, and visual data, allowing multimodal integration to improve the early detection of mild cognitive impairment. Research in the field using convolutional neural networks is also increasing, and some studies have developed a novel deep learning method (\n49\n) using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (\n50\n) for prediction. Machine learning used to quickly and accurately identify individual mild cognitive impairment is crucial.\nAutomated monitoring of mild cognitive impairment: traditionally, diagnostic methods such as neurocognitive tests, blood tests, and spinal fluid analysis are laborious, time-consuming, and error-prone. At present, the number of automatic EEG signal analysis using machine learning technology and automatic MCI diagnosis based on EEG (\n51\n) has increased repeatedly. Using machine learning techniques to use natural language processing (\n52\n) to reveal individual cognitive states from recordings and automatically detect mild cognitive impairment is a relatively applicable approach to real-world environments.

Wearable sensor technology (\n55\n) by collecting physiological and behavioral data appears to hold promise to provide a proxy measure of cognitive function. Many MCI cases may not allow accurate and timely diagnosis, but technologies such as novel automated methods for early identification tracking and accurate MCI diagnosis and smart devices that combine machine learning algorithms promise to open new perspectives in bridging these aspects. In addition, machine learning also plays an extremely important role in the interdisciplinary data integration and personalized medicine in the MCI field. Machine learning can integrate data from different sources, such as neuroimaging, genetic, and behavioral data, to provide a more comprehensive view of the patient's condition. Machine learning models that combine multidimensional data and cognitive test results perform better in predicting MCI progression than models using only a single data type.

Keyword analysis is helpful to understand the research topic, (\nTable 5\n) shows that the key keywords in this study are \"Machine Learning,\" \"Mild Cognitive Impairment,\" \"Dementia,\" \"Classification,\" \"Diagnosis.\" A further analysis from (\nFigures 6\n,\n7\n) shows that the early identification, early diagnosis, early monitoring and early intervention of individual MCI with AI-based machine learning methods show the importance and urgent attention to this field.\nEarly accurate diagnosis technology deepening: Machine learning plays a key role in the early diagnosis of MCI. Using the fusion of multimodal data (such as neuroimaging, genomics, behavioral data, etc.), it can significantly improve the diagnostic accuracy. At present, the research hotspot in this field is to optimize the multimodal data fusion algorithm and mine the potential correlation between the data to achieve more accurate early identification. It can be seen from the text that the keywords \"early diagnosis,\" \"computer-aided diagnosis\" and \"neuroimaging\" appear more frequently, reflecting the researchers' high attention to this direction. By integrating magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), sleep electroencephalography (sleep EEG) and other imaging data, such as machine learning classification algorithms, it can effectively distinguish MCI patients from normal individuals, buying valuable time for early intervention.\nOptimization of remote monitoring system: With the progress of technology, the remote monitoring system based on machine learning has become a research hotspot. With the help of physiological and behavioral data collected by wearable devices and smart home systems, machine learning algorithms can analyze changes in patients' cognitive functions in real time, enabling remote and continuous monitoring. As mentioned in the article, that \"continuous assessment and remote monitoring of cognitive function\" is one of the current research directions, such as using the data collected by wearable sensors to predict the disease progression of MCI patients, help medical staff to adjust the treatment plan in time, improve the quality of life of patients, and reduce the burden of medical resources.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/545", "#/texts/546", "#/texts/547", "#/texts/548", "#/texts/549", "#/texts/550", "#/texts/551", "#/texts/552", "#/texts/553"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "0804f328-0048-49f9-8fd6-cc5fa162dc22"}

In light of the practical challenges in conducting a full-cycle risk assessment for cognitive function objects, an alternative and highly promising area for exploration is the development of longitudinal warning models. These models, powered by advanced machine learning algorithms, integrate cross-sectional warning results from multiple time points, offering a novel approach beyond traditional cross-sectional alerts. Existing studies are commonly seen in combined models that combine longitudinal cognitive function assessment and survival analysis.

In the future, biology, medicine and computer science will work closely together to build a more complete predictive model of cognitive impairment. By integrating biological markers and machine learning algorithms, it is expected to find more specific MCI predictors and improve the accuracy and reliability of prediction. Combined with the research results of neuroscience on the cognitive mechanism of the brain, the structure and algorithm of the machine learning model are optimized to make it more in line with the cognitive process of the brain and provide a more scientific basis for the diagnosis and treatment of MCI.\nInnovation driven by AI technology: The continuous innovation of AI technology will bring new opportunities for the application of machine learning in MCI. In the future, more advanced deep learning algorithms, such as models based on transformer architecture, may be widely used in the study of MCI. These algorithms are able to better handle complex multimodal data, mine deep features in the data, and further improve the performance of disease prediction and diagnosis.
