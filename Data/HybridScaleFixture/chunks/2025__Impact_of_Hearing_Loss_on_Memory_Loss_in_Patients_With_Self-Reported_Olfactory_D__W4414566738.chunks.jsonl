Several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, impact the olfactory system early in their progression. Despite these established correlations, the independent effect of hearing loss on memory in patients with self-reported olfactory dysfunction is poorly elucidated, which this study aims to investigate, especially in light of the prevalence of anosmia post-COVID-19.\n\nMethods\nA total of 591 records of adult patients with self-reported olfactory dysfunction without a history of traumatic brain injury (TBI) from 2015 to 2020 from a single academic institution were analyzed. Patients were stratified based on demographic, memory loss (including mild cognitive impairment (MCI)), and clinical factors.

Approximately 15% of American adults experience some degree of hearing loss, with the prevalence rising significantly among individuals aged 65 and older. Etiologies of hearing loss are multifactorial, but predominantly sensorineural, with risk factors including aging, noise exposure, and chronic medical conditions, including diabetes and cardiovascular disease [1]. Pre-COVID-19, partial and complete anosmia were estimated to affect 19.1% of the population [2]. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, anosmia, or the loss of the sense of smell, has become more prominent, with more than 50% of COVID-19+ individuals experiencing ongoing olfactory dysfunction (OD) months after acute recovery [3]. Approximately 60% of COVID-19+ individuals have experienced partial or complete OD, and persistent anosmia rates following upper respiratory infections (URIs) are estimated to be 10% in the USA [2,4]. Lastly, memory loss, from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to neurodegenerative demigentias, impacts an estimated 20%-30% of individuals aged 65 and older in the USA and is projected to increase as the global population ages [5].\n&lt;!-- image --&gt;\nHearing loss has been identified as a significant modifiable risk factor for dementia and has been linked with increased cognitive load. The additional mental resources needed to process auditory cues in individuals with hearing loss typically come at the expense of bandwidth for non-auditory cognitive functions [1,6]. Additionally, given that hearing loss can lead to social isolation due to the inability or difficulty comprehending verbal communication, this can exacerbate the underlying risk of dementia psychosocially by reducing opportunities for cognitive stimulation [7,8]. Furthermore, Erkkinen et al. demonstrated neuroanatomical differences in individuals with hearing impairment at baseline, including reduced brain volume in auditory and cognitive regions secondary to neural pruning mechanisms [9,10]. However, despite these theories, the quantitative relationship between the degree of memory loss and neurodegeneration due to hearing impairment is still not fully elucidated.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/16", "#/pictures/1", "#/texts/19"], "page_nos": [1], "uuid": "1a52385a-e57a-4e14-9f71-0d912ef44064"}

In particular, OD has been recognized as a robust early marker of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease [12]. Among individuals with normal cognitive function at baseline, any OD is linked to an increased risk of developing dementia [13-15]. In addition, OD can strongly predict the risk of conversion from mild cognitive impairment to dementia, with an estimated risk increase exceeding 80% between cohorts with increasing subjective degrees of OD [16,17]. Anosmia, a more severe form of OD, is associated with a higher risk of developing dementia compared to milder conditions, especially among men and individuals aged 78 and younger [13]. Although it remains unclear whether anosmia is a causative factor or an early symptom of neurodegeneration, many proposed explanations of this pathology highlight increased underlying risks even in individuals below the subclinical threshold [13,18,19]. This underscores the need for research into the shared pathophysiology and management strategies for dual olfactory and cognitive impairment.\nThe independent relationships between hearing loss and dementia, as well as anosmia and dementia, are well-established. However, the interaction between hearing loss and anosmia in the context of cognitive decline has not yet been thoroughly investigated. Although it is well-known that sensory losses increase the risk of neurodegeneration, the interaction between hearing loss and anosmia in the context of cognitive decline has not been thoroughly investigated. Especially in light of the increased prevalence of postCOVID-19-related anosmia, it is increasingly pertinent to explore the risk factors that may elevate the likelihood of developing dementia in patients with anosmia. As hearing loss is an established, modifiable risk factor for dementia, its potential role as an additional disability in this context deserves further exploration. By elucidating the shared pathophysiology and possible superimposed risk for cognitive impairment, screening interventions targeting at-risk populations can be conducted.

This study demonstrated that dual sensory deficits may have a greater impact on morbidity than previously acknowledged. Our results demonstrate that hearing loss in patients with anosmia increases the risk of developing memory loss-related conditions, such as cognitive impairment and dementia. Literature explanations of prior proposed mechanistic relationships between hearing loss and increased risk of dementia may be explained by three factors: decreased hippocampal and entorhinal cortex volume, reduced socialization, and increased cognitive load associated with living with hearing loss [1,7,8]. Individuals with pre-existing OD are already at an elevated risk of developing dementia, likely driven by neurodegenerative pathological processes, such as protein buildup in the olfactory bulbs and tracts [21]. Thus, as supported by our findings, our addition of hearing loss may compound this risk by further increasing cognitive load, intensifying social isolation, and exacerbating functional limitations that reduce physical activity. Together, these factors may create a cumulative effect, significantly raising the likelihood of cognitive decline and dementia [22].", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/63", "#/pictures/7", "#/texts/67", "#/texts/68", "#/texts/69", "#/texts/70", "#/texts/72", "#/texts/73"], "page_nos": [1], "uuid": "fe15c948-fbbc-4820-8a00-138f71aa483b"}

Watson et al. demonstrated that even COVID-19+ individuals with anosmia are often unaware of their sensory deficits, leading to massive underreporting [23]. Studies indicate that less than one-third of those with OD recognize their impairment, while nearly one-third of individuals with hearing loss are unaware of their condition [24,25]. Even when raised to the threshold of clinical attention, self-reports of these conditions consistently underestimate the extent of the impairment when compared to objective measures, such as audiology and olfactory tests [15,24,26]. This especially holds true among older adults, potentially due to individuals adapting to their hearing loss over time or considering it an inevitable aspect of aging [24]. This low sensitivity of self-reports for OD is due to a general lack of awareness, even in well-educated and health-conscious populations [25]. Given the findings of this study, it is critical that the underlying hearing loss is mitigated with appropriate interventions, especially in populations with numerous sensory deficits.\nAs demonstrated previously, hearing loss and anosmia have both been independently associated with an increased risk of developing dementia. Our study has demonstrated that hearing loss in patients with anosmia is linked to a greater association with memory loss-related conditions. Therefore, this paper adds to the literature on the impact of dual sensory deficits, which may be crucial for informing early interventions and tailored management strategies. Examples of early interventions include hearing aids and olfactory training, which have been shown to improve olfactory function and potentially mitigate cognitive decline by enhancing neural plasticity [27,28]. Furthermore, early screening interventions for sensory losses have been shown to successfully identify subclinical hearing loss/olfactory deficits and prevent delays in diagnosis and an increase in morbidity that would otherwise result from the time for deficits to rise to clinical and the patient's attention (Figure 2) [29]. It is critical to implement screenings for individuals using validated objective tests.

Additionally, the study used a CPT code to identify memory loss-related conditions, which range from mild cognitive impairment to dementia, instead of using a standardized cognitive assessment tool such as the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). All CPT-extracted data variables were cross-verified by manually parsing through patient problem lists and noted diagnoses to verify the accuracy of the diagnosis. Furthermore, no objective measure of olfactory dysfunction was utilized; as such, this study is limited by self-reported concerns of OD. Despite manual review of all CPT codes, the risk of misclassification cannot be ruled out, especially given the self-reported nature of data variables. However, prior literature evidence demonstrated that self-reported OD was often underreported in comparison to objective OD. Additionally, since our patient sample was limited to a single institution, expanding inclusion criteria to multiple institutions and geographic locations could increase the generalizability of these results.

As a result, the relationship between the variables time and courses may not be well-elucidated, and causal inference is limited.\nFuture research should aim to validate these findings in a prospective design with questionnaires to standardized hearing loss, anosmia, and cognitive impairment screenings, and determine mechanisms that mitigate this relationship. Interventions that could help in mitigating risks include increased screenings for patients who present for COVID-19 or present with a decreased sense of smell to undergo audiology at that appointment as well.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/pictures/8", "#/texts/79", "#/texts/80"], "page_nos": [1], "uuid": "c44bce61-0d49-4ac4-bc21-a609b8917d36"}

Our results show that hearing impairment may be significantly associated with memory loss on retrospective analysis, specifically in patients with selfreported olfactory dysfunction. This may highlight the increased risk of memory loss in this population and suggest the need for further research into screening and pathophysiology of memory loss in hard-of-hearing patients with olfactory dysfunction, especially post-COVID-19, as well as prospective studies with objective questionnaires to explore the potential of causal relationships further.\n\nAuthor Contributions\nAll authors have reviewed the final version to be published and agreed to be accountable for all aspects of the work.\nConcept and design: Mitali Sakharkar, Marianella Paz-Lansberg, Jessica Levi\nAcquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data: Mitali Sakharkar, Asritha Sure, Mingqian Tan, Marianella Paz-Lansberg, Jessica Levi\nDrafting of the manuscript: Mitali Sakharkar, Asritha Sure, Mingqian Tan\nCritical review of the manuscript for important intellectual content: Mitali Sakharkar, Marianella PazLansberg, Jessica Levi\nSupervision: Jessica Levi\n\nDisclosures\nHuman subjects: Informed consent for treatment and open access publication was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.
