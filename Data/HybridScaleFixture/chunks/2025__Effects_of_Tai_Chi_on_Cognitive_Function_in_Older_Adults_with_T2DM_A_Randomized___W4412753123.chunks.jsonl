All indicators were assessed at baseline and 12-week follow-up. The usual care includes traditional diabetes education. Participants in the fitness walking group performed walking exercises on a treadmill under the supervision of a researcher 3 times a week for 12 weeks. Participants in the Tai Chi group practiced 24-style Simplified Tai Chi through live video streaming under the guidance of professors and professionals. In this 12-week program, participants underwent continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) using Guardian Sensors 3, CGM sensors attached to the upper arm. All participants carried bracelets to record their heart rate, sleep parameters, and steps. The primary outcome was the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) at 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes included other cognitive subdomain tests and blood metabolic indices.

As many as 60% of T2DM patients suffer from cognitive decline, which can lead to reduced quality of life, increased risk of dementia, and higher health care costs [\n2\n,\n3\n]. Considering these issues, it has become imperative to identify effective interventions to mitigate cognitive decline in this population.\nIt is well-documented that exercise can have both immediate and long-term effects on diabetes management [\n4\n]. The American College of Sports Medicine states that regular physical activity may have a positive impact on the psychological state and cognitive abilities of people with T2DM [\n4\n]. Tai Chi, characterized by slow, deliberate, and mentally focused movements, has been shown to improve physical performance, enhance balance, and reduce stress [\n5\n]. Importantly, Tai Chi also incorporates elements of cognitive engagement and social interaction, which may collectively contribute to the positive effects of Tai Chi on brain health [\n6\n]. However, it is rather challenging to select the optimal program from the available evidence-based cognitive interventions due to the considerable lack of relevant comparative effectiveness studies, especially for remote interventions.\nThe emergence of mobile health (mHealth) technologies, particularly wearable devices, presents new opportunities for more effective monitoring and management of chronic diseases, such as T2DM [\n7\n]. By integrating these devices into health care interventions, researchers and practitioners can collect real-time data on patient health parameters, enabling more personalized and data-driven health care.\nWith this in mind, we designed a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to investigate the effects of Tai Chi and walking on cognitive function in older adults with T2DM using wearable devices within a mobile healthcare model. The objectives of this study were twofold: first, to assess whether Tai Chi practice combined with wearable device-based monitoring improves cognitive function in this population, and second, to explore the underlying mechanisms for any improvements observed, including changes in physical activity levels and sleep patterns.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/211", "#/texts/212", "#/texts/213", "#/texts/214", "#/texts/215", "#/texts/216", "#/texts/217", "#/texts/218", "#/texts/219", "#/texts/220", "#/texts/221", "#/texts/222", "#/texts/223", "#/texts/224", "#/texts/225", "#/texts/226", "#/texts/227", "#/texts/228", "#/texts/229", "#/texts/230"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "e50e9f97-c9b7-4db9-aee6-5e3180546f0d"}

This assumption was based on the results of a previous randomized controlled trial examining the effects of Tai Chi on cognitive function in elderly patients [\n9\n]. This study found that at 36 weeks, the Tai Chi group had improved MoCA scores compared with the fitness walking group (mean [\n10\n], 24.67 [SD 2.72] vs 23.84 [SD 3.17]; between-group mean difference, 0.84 [95% CI 0.02-1.66];\nP\n=.046).

Education for this population included a proper diet, monitoring of blood glucose levels, and prevention of complications. The usual care group participants did not receive exercise interventions and maintained their original lifestyles. Participants in the fitness walking group performed walking exercises on a treadmill under the supervision of a researcher three times a week for 12 weeks. Each training session lasts 1 hour. Participants in the Tai Chi group practiced 24-style Simplified Tai Chi through live video streaming under the guidance of professors and professionals. Two professional Tai Chi instructors teach all 24-style Simplified Tai Chi movements via remote video. Participants practiced 24-style Simplified Tai Chi 3 times a week for 30 minutes, which included 5 minutes of warm-up and cool-down activities before and after each session. The 24-style Simplified Tai Chi consists of 24 movements, which are more refined and standardized than traditional routines and can fully reflect the movement characteristics of Tai Chi [\n11\n]. Tai Chi is a mind-body workout designed to integrate musculoskeletal, sensory, and cognitive systems. It focuses on controlled, self-initiated movement and synchronized breathing, encompassing movement patterns such as weight shifting, weight-bearing and lifting, trunk and pelvic rotation, and eye-hand coordination movements [\n12\n]. To control attendance, staff registered and monitored the training diaries of both groups of trainees.\n24-style Simplified Tai Chi consists of 24 movements, which are more refined and standardized than traditional routines, and can fully reflect the movement characteristics of Tai Chi [\n11\n].

A previous study using direct calorimetry to measure metabolic expenditure reported that Tai Chi has an intensity of 3.24 METs, placing it within the moderate-intensity range [\n13\n]. The exercise intensity of the fitness walking group was in the range of 3.3-5.5 METs, according to the Compendium of Physical Activities [\n14\n]. To monitor exercise intensity, we used heart rate (HR) as a key indicator. The target HR zone was set at 65%-75% of maximum heart rate (HR), calculated using the formula: Maximum HR=220\u2212age.\nIn this 12-week program study, participants underwent continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) using Guardian Sensors 3, which are CGM sensors attached to the upper arm. All participants wore bracelets to record their heart rate, sleep parameters, and steps. Sleep parameters include the following data: total sleep time (the number of minutes slept between bedtime and wake time), sleep efficiency (the percentage of time spent asleep while in bed), and wake after sleep onset (the number of minutes awake between sleep onset and wake time).\n\nEffects of Tai Chi on Cognitive Function in Older Adults With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Randomized Controlled Trial Using Wearable Devices in a Mobile Health Model\nEffects of Tai Chi on Cognitive Function in Older Adults With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Randomized Controlled Trial Using Wearable Devices in a Mobile Health Model\nMethods\nFollow-Up\nAll indicators were assessed at baseline and 12 weeks of follow-up.

Specifically, after 12 weeks, cognitive benefits were obtained with both exercise modalities; however, the effects on specific cognitive domains differed. Participants in the Tai Chi group exhibited significantly higher scores on the MoCA, Memory Quotient (MQ), and Trail Making Test Part B (TMT-B) compared with both the fitness walking group and the usual care group. Furthermore, the Tai Chi group also showed significantly improved total sleep time and reduced wake after sleep onset compared with the fitness walking group.\nThe MoCA is a tool designed for rapid screening for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early dementia, with the core advantage of being more sensitive to early cognitive problems than traditional scales such as the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) [\n20\n]. In investigations where the primary goal is to identify patients with potential cognitive impairment, especially in the early stages, a MoCA cutoff score of\n21\n].\nPreviously, the efficacy of Tai Chi for patients with T2DM was uncertain. Although physical exercise is generally considered beneficial for cognitive function in individuals with diabetes, randomized clinical trials have shown inconsistent effects on overall cognitive function and specific cognitive subdomains [\n22\n,\n23\n]. Their findings show similarities with ours.\nPrevious studies have shown that the MoCA decreases yearly in patients with T2DM [\n21\n], and our study demonstrated an improvement in MoCA after the Tai Chi intervention. Our randomized clinical trial revealed that Tai Chi improves overall cognitive performance and memory function. This finding is consistent with a recently published meta-analysis. This meta-analysis showed that overall cognitive function was significantly enhanced when Tai Chi was increased from 20 to 40 minutes to 60 minutes [\n24\n]. Findings on T2DM, body mass index (BMI), and comorbidities suggest that interventions may be more effective in the early or mild stages of T2DM [\n25\n].", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/516", "#/texts/517", "#/texts/518", "#/texts/519", "#/texts/520", "#/texts/521", "#/texts/522", "#/texts/523", "#/texts/524", "#/texts/525", "#/texts/526", "#/texts/527", "#/texts/528", "#/texts/529", "#/texts/530", "#/texts/531", "#/texts/532", "#/texts/533"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "d25a2ed4-9574-45ae-8d4d-98dd0313a6d1"}

Independent replication studies are needed to validate these findings. Specifically, the MQ scores of the Tai Chi group increased by almost 10 points on average, while the fitness walking group showed a minor improvement; in terms of TMT-B, the average score of the Tai Chi group was lower than that of the fitness walking group, implying that the Tai Chi group was faster and more efficient in performing the complex task, which reflected the unique advantage of Tai Chi in improving cognitive function. These results support the idea that Tai Chi, as an effective form of physical and mental exercise, enhances physical function and significantly improves cognitive ability [\n26\n].\nProtection of prefrontal-hippocampal neural circuits is crucial in intervention strategies aimed at preventing cognitive decline [\n27\n]. A randomized controlled trial showed that 12 weeks of standardized Tai Chi training (5 sessions/week) significantly improved functional coupling of the medial prefrontal cortex to the bilateral hippocampus in healthy older adults, which was accompanied by an 18% increase in the Logical Memory subscale of the Wechsler Memory Scale (\nP\n=.003) [\n28\n]. Most studies have found that Tai Chi consistently increases frontal lobe activity, frontotemporal lobe functional connectivity, and hippocampal volume. Tai Chi-related improvements in memory and cognitive control associated with Tai Chi are driven by increased activity in the medial prefrontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and the frontoparietal network [\n29\n].", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/534", "#/texts/535", "#/texts/536", "#/texts/537", "#/texts/538", "#/texts/539", "#/texts/540", "#/texts/541", "#/texts/542", "#/texts/543", "#/texts/544", "#/texts/545", "#/texts/546", "#/texts/547"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "281ac485-907f-46f3-a51d-80ff02d21769"}

As the top center for regulating cognitive and emotional activity, the prefrontal cortex is highly susceptible to the effects of aging [\n31\n]. Studies have shown that participation in Tai Chi exercise significantly enhances resting-state functional connectivity between the medial prefrontal cortex and the bilateral hippocampus [\n32\n]. There is a positive correlation between this enhancement of connectivity and improvements in memory function, as assessed by the Wechsler Memory Scale [\n33\n]. In addition, another study showed that 8 weeks of Tai Chi training were more effective than regular aerobic exercise in improving the nodal clustering coefficient of the left thalamus, which reflects the effectiveness of information processing and transmission between this brain region and its peripheral regions [\n34\n]. This finding is consistent with the higher cognitive flexibility demonstrated by Tai Chi practitioners [\n35\n]. Given the key role of the thalamus in attention regulation, working memory maintenance, and sleep regulation, Tai Chi is particularly beneficial in slowing the natural decline of cognitive function with age [\n10\n].\nIn addition, the study found that the Tai Chi group showed a significant increase in total sleep time, which may be related to Tai Chi's ability to relieve stress and enhance sleep quality [\n36\n]. A good night's sleep is a critical factor in maintaining physical and mental health; therefore, this additional benefit of Tai Chi deserves further attention and exploration [\n37\n].", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/548", "#/texts/549", "#/texts/550", "#/texts/551", "#/texts/552", "#/texts/553", "#/texts/554", "#/texts/555", "#/texts/556", "#/texts/557", "#/texts/558", "#/texts/559", "#/texts/560", "#/texts/561", "#/texts/562", "#/texts/563", "#/texts/564", "#/texts/565", "#/texts/566", "#/texts/567"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "cab6392e-bf7a-48d7-b8bf-13713a7d0a54"}

These findings suggest that remotely monitored exercise with wearable digital devices and glucose monitoring is more effective than unsupervised management [\n38\n]. T2DM patients are monitored and managed through wearable digital devices and continuous glucose monitoring, and remote exercise guidance is provided through the Tencent Meeting app. Mobile devices collect users' health data (eg, steps and sleep quality) and provide customized interventions tailored to each individual's situation. Compared with traditional interventions, mobile device-based interventions can significantly reduce labor and material costs [\n39\n].\nSubgroup analyses in our study showed that the Tai Chi group outperformed the fitness walking group in terms of overall cognitive and memory function in women and patients with a BMI of 24.00 or less who had T2DM for more than 10 years and had one or fewer comorbidities. This compares with previous studies showing a higher prevalence of dementia in women [\n40\n].

Second, although the sample size exceeded the minimum requirements for statistical analysis, it was still relatively small and concentrated in one geographic area, making it impossible to objectively assess cohort effects. The sample size and recruitment area should be expanded to minimize geographic effects and limitations. Third, although it's impossible to eliminate potential expectation biases in the Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs) collected, the primary outcomes assessed through objective laboratory parameters are unlikely to be influenced by the participants' or physicians' awareness of the interventions received. Fourth, a limitation of this study is the unequal duration of exercise interventions (30 min of Tai Chi vs 60 min of fitness walking), which may confound comparisons of total energy expenditure and physiological stress. Although both interventions were matched for intensity (40%-59% of heart rate reserve), the longer duration of fitness walking may have contributed independently to the outcomes. Future studies should standardize exercise volume (eg, MET hours per week) or directly measure energy expenditure to isolate the effects of exercise type on outcomes. Fifth, the duration of the intervention in this study was only 12 weeks, which is shorter than the durations of 6 months, 12 months, or even 2 years in other studies [\n41\n,\n42\n]. One of the significant challenges for patients is maintaining their exercise habits over a year or more. Therefore, we will develop follow-up strategies based on the study's results to support participants after the study period.\nUltimately, this study recommends the use of remote exercise instruction via wearable digital devices and smartphones. This may have excluded individuals of lower socioeconomic status. In the future, it will be crucial to develop strategies that enhance access to the necessary technology and ensure all individuals have equal access to these programs.

Tai Chi has significant advantages in improving cognitive function and sleep quality, while fitness walking, although also beneficial, is relatively weak in these areas. These findings provide a scientific basis for promoting Tai Chi as a form of exercise that benefits both body and mind and also suggest that we should consider comprehensive individual needs and health conditions when choosing an exercise method. Future studies could further investigate the specific benefits of Tai Chi for various populations and explore the potential effects of combining it with other exercise modalities.\nAcknowledgments\nThis research did not receive any specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial, or non-profit sector.
