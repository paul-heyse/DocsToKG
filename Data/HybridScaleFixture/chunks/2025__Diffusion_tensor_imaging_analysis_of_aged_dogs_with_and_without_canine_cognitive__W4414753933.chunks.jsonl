Despite this, in vivo imaging of CCD has been limited, and to our knowledge, no studies have investigated the use of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to assess brain atrophy in this condition. The primary aim of this study was to determine whether DTI could detect differences in white matter microstructure between aged dogs with CCD and cognitively healthy aged dogs. A secondary aim was to evaluate correlations between DTI parameters and cognitive scores derived from the Canine Dementia Scale (CADES). We hypothesized that dogs with CCD would show lower fractional anisotropy (FA) and higher mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AxD), and radial diffusivity (RD) in the corpus callosum (CC) and thalamus. We further hypothesized that these changes would correlate with cognitive dysfunction severity.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/1", "#/texts/2", "#/texts/3", "#/texts/4", "#/texts/5", "#/texts/6", "#/texts/7", "#/texts/8", "#/texts/9", "#/texts/10", "#/texts/11", "#/texts/12", "#/texts/13", "#/texts/14", "#/texts/15", "#/texts/16", "#/texts/17", "#/texts/18", "#/texts/19", "#/texts/20", "#/texts/21", "#/texts/22", "#/texts/23", "#/texts/25", "#/texts/26", "#/texts/27", "#/texts/28", "#/texts/29", "#/texts/30", "#/texts/31", "#/texts/32", "#/texts/33", "#/texts/34", "#/texts/35", "#/texts/36", "#/texts/37", "#/texts/38", "#/texts/39", "#/texts/40", "#/texts/43"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "5fcb2265-f18c-47a7-857e-61842ed0c21c"}

Our findings suggest that axonal degeneration, as reflected by increased MD and RD values, correlates with worsening cognitive impairment. These patterns align with findings reported in Alzheimer's disease and support the potential use of DTI to monitor neuropathological progression in dogs with CCD. Overall, our results highlight the utility of DTI in characterizing structural brain changes associated with CCD and reinforce the translational relevance of CCD as a model for AD.

Shared pathological changes between CCD and AD include amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) plaques, cerebral atrophy, ventricular enlargement, and axonal degradation [\n1\n,\n2\n,\n3\n] Canines seem to be a promising model for AD due to their spontaneous development of neuropathological changes and shared environmental risk factors with humans [\n4\n]. Cognitive changes due to CCD include disorientation, sleep-wake disturbance, and house-soiling, all of which are relatively easy to identify and monitor by owners as disease severity progress [\n4\n,\n5\n]. However, advanced imaging studies-particularly diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-are still needed to validate dogs as a robust Alzheimer's disease model.\nConventional MRI studies in both AD and CCD have previously reported cortical or hippocampal atrophy, ventricular enlargement, and diffuse white-matter signal change, but these macroscopic findings cannot reveal microstructural injury [\n6\n,\n7\n,\n8\n]. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been shown to be promising for evaluating microstructural white matter integrity in humans with AD [\n9\n,\n10\n]. DTI measures the directionality and magnitude of the diffusion of water molecules in a tissue and can characterize demyelination and axonal degradation throughout the brain [\n11\n,\n12\n,\n13\n]. Studies have suggested that DTI can differentiate AD from normal brain aging and may serve as a biomarker for the risk of AD in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) [\n14\n,\n15\n,\n16\n]. However, there is a lack of consensus about the efficacy of DTI in distinguishing AD from aging pathology [\n17\n,\n18\n].

Thus, comparing levels of amyloid beta in the blood to DTI parameters may provide insight into how diffusivity changes throughout the progression of disease from mild to severe cognitive impairment. Overall, integrating biomarker data with DTI findings may enhance the diagnostic accuracy and monitoring capabilities for CCD. This combined approach could also strengthen the utility of CCD as a translational model for Alzheimer's disease (AD).", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/223", "#/texts/224", "#/texts/225", "#/texts/226", "#/texts/227", "#/texts/228", "#/texts/229", "#/texts/230", "#/texts/231", "#/texts/232", "#/texts/233", "#/texts/234"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "514255ff-6e7f-4ca8-b043-25952341384b"}

We observed positive correlations between CADES scores and MD and RD values, indicating that axonal integrity declines with increased severity of cognitive impairment. These findings align with patterns observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and support the potential of CCD as a translational model for AD research. Despite technical limitations and a small samples size, our results establish a foundation for future studies investigating DTI as a diagnostic and monitoring tool in aging canine populations. Further research with larger cohorts and complementary biomarkers is warranted to validate these findings and improve the understanding of CCD pathophysiology.\n\nDiffusion tensor imaging analysis of aged dogs with and without canine cognitive dysfunction\nMethods\nSubjects\nThirty-two canine subjects were prospectively recruited from client populations at the Colorado State University Veterinary Teaching Hospital, Fort Collins, CO, USA, between 8/19/2021 and 2/10/2023. All aspects of this study were approved by the Colorado State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and the Clinical Review Board (IACUC protocol numbers: 4106 and 3384). Informed consent to perform MR imaging under general anesthesia and use of data for study was obtained from all owners prior to the procedure. Euthanasia was not performed as a part of this study. There were 16 castrated males and 16 spayed females from 17 different breeds: American Pit Bull Terrier (\nn\n= 1), Australian Shephard (2), Blue Tick Hound (1), Border Collie (2), Boxer (1), Chesapeake Bay Retriever (1), Cocker Spaniel (2), Dachshund (1), German Shepherd (2), German Shorthaired Pointer (1), Labrador Retriever (2), Miniature Poodle (1), Pug (3), Rhodesian Ridgeback (1), Shih Tzu (1), Weimaraner (1), and mixed breed (9).

It is standard practice to anesthetize dogs for MR imaging. All dogs recovered uneventfully after the MRI sequences were acquired. Animals were premedicated with methadone (0.1-0.5 mg/kg) or butorphanol (0.1-0.5 mg/kg). Preoxygenation and monitoring equipment was placed prior to induction (as tolerated). Propofol (2-5 mg/kg) and midazolam (0.1-0.2 mg/kg) were administered intravenously. Mechanical ventilation began immediately after induction to prevent an increase in carbon dioxide.

Heart rate and rhythm, body temperature, direct arterial blood pressure, end-tidal carbon dioxide and oxygen saturation levels were monitored throughout the procedure.

Clinical Trials Coordinator was aware of group allocation throughout the study and unblinded data post MRI analysis. To overcome the anatomical and brain size variations across the dog subjects, manual ROI selection was performed using the\nFsleyes edit\nmode [\n50\n]. The following regions were considered for analysis due to histopathological changes observed in dogs with CCD [\n3\n]: thalamus, hippocampus, corpus callosum, fornix, and cortex. Image distortion and low resolution inhibited consistent delineation of the hippocampus, fornix, and cortical regions. Therefore, the splenium of the corpus callosum (CC) and thalamus were selected as ROIs because of feasibility of voxel selection based on consistent MRI quality/resolution. Veterinary neurology resident (M.U.) and veterinary neurology research assistant (J.H.) individually selected voxels for the ROIs for each image sample, and after all analyses were completed, the average of the two ROIs for each image was used. All images were visually inspected, and datasets with severe distortion that prevented reliable ROI delineation in the CC or thalamus were marked for exclusion.\nFour voxels from the splenium of the CC and eight voxels from the thalamus were included in the ROI to minimize contamination from extraneous structures while maximizing the data points included within the mean of each parameter. Transverse sections of the FA map were used for visualization of structures, and color FA map was used to enhance visibility of axonal tracts and avoid contamination of the internal capsule when selecting voxels of the thalamus ROI and ventricles when selecting voxels for the CC ROI [\n51\n].
