Deficits can lead to impairments in everyday activities. Visual perception is known to be impaired in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the extent to which visual perception is impaired in mild cognitive impairment (MCI), often a prodromal state of AD, has not been sufficiently investigated. This study aims to assess visual perceptual abilities in people with MCI and mild AD compared with healthy controls. It will also investigate whether executive functions, activities of daily living and intelligence are affected in this context, providing new insights into the research of visual perception together with MCI and mild AD.\nMethods and analysis\nPeople with MCI, mild AD and healthy controls will be assessed for cognitive deficits using the Syndrom-Kurztest (SKT). Visual perceptual performance will be assessed using the German version of the Developmental Test of Visual Perception-Adolescent and Adult: Second Edition (DTVP-A:2; Frostings Entwicklungstest der visuellen Wahrnehmung - Jugendliche und Erwachsene 2. Auflage). Activities of daily living will be assessed through the Erlangen Test of Activities of Daily Living in Persons with Mild Dementia or Mild Cognitive Impairment (ETAM) and the Bayer Activities of Daily Living Scale (B-ADL). Executive functions will be measured using the German adaptation of the Behaviour Rating Inventory of Executive Function - Adult (BRIEF-A) and intelligence will be assessed using the Matrix Reasoning and Vocabulary Test of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale - Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV). Data analysis will involve descriptive analyses, linear regression analyses, multivariate analysis of variance, mediation analysis and structural equation modelling.\nEthics and dissemination\nThis study has received approval from the Ethics Committee of Helmut Schmidt University/University of the Federal Armed Forces Hamburg, Germany (number: 2023\\_009). Findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and presentations at national and international conferences.\nTrial registration number\nRegistered at OSF\nhttps://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/PM5AV\n- Cognition\n- Cross-Sectional Studies\n- Dementia\n- Old age psychiatry", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/54", "#/texts/55", "#/texts/56", "#/texts/57", "#/texts/58", "#/texts/59", "#/texts/60", "#/texts/61", "#/texts/62", "#/texts/63", "#/texts/64", "#/texts/65", "#/texts/66"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "1068de9e-3a95-4030-a08b-9c64756a8ea3"}

Due to the overlapping roles of these brain areas in visual perception, executive functioning and intelligence, distinguishing disease-specific patterns remains a methodological challenge. Nonetheless, functional neuroimaging findings offer valuable insights into the interplay of visual and cognitive systems in neurodegeneration.\n\nVisual perception and cognitive functioning in MCI and mild Alzheimer's disease: a cross-sectional study protocol from the DEM-VIS study in Germany | BMJ Open\nMethods and analysis\nAim of the planned work\nThe aim of the present study is to assess the visual perceptual abilities of people with MCI and mild AD in comparison with healthy controls to examine whether there are any differences in visual perception between these groups. Moreover, the study will investigate whether executive functions and intelligence are also affected in this context. This is a pertinent issue in light of the identification of brain regions involved in both visual perception and executive functions. In this context, ADLs will also be investigated, as they are connected with executive functions and are known to be deteriorated in MCI and mild AD. Furthermore, with respect to intelligence, it is of interest to determine whether this acts as a protective factor, as higher intelligence is associated with higher connectivity, or whether intelligence changes as a result of degeneration in MCI and AD. The findings of this study will provide valuable insights for advancing research on MCI and mild AD, as the impact of visual perceptual performance in these disorders has not been sufficiently explored. The study offers a foundation for the advancement and refinement of theoretical frameworks by identifying the function of visual perception in healthy controls, MCI and mild AD. Furthermore, the findings can be used to develop methods for the early detection of potential MCI or mild AD, as well as to suggest preventive and therapeutic approaches.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/239", "#/texts/240", "#/texts/241", "#/texts/242", "#/texts/243", "#/texts/246"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "8fc97cf4-89c5-47d9-817a-ec05d27657f5"}

MCI is characterised by marginal impairment in complex daily activities and mild deterioration of specific cognitive abilities, occurring between the normal age-related decline and the development of dementia.\n2\nIt is probable that individuals with MCI will develop dementia over time, particularly AD.\n4 19 84\nThe results of this study will provide important information for research into MCI, as the influence of visual perceptual performance in this disorder has not been sufficiently investigated.\nA major strength of this study is that several constructs are examined in order to obtain the most comprehensive overview of the differences in abilities or cognitive domains between the healthy control group, MCI and AD. This is particularly important given that MCI is a very heterogeneous condition.\n11 26\nAlthough our research group combines expertise from psychology, medical psychology and psychiatry, we rely on treating physicians to confirm diagnoses of mild AD, as we do not conduct laboratory and imaging diagnostics ourselves. Consequently, we are reliant on the confirmation of the diagnosis by the treating physicians. To address this, we require participants to have clinical confirmation of mild AD via a medical questionnaire.\n\nVisual perception and cognitive functioning in MCI and mild Alzheimer's disease: a cross-sectional study protocol from the DEM-VIS study in Germany | BMJ Open\nSummary\nStudy status\nParticipant recruitment has begun at the end of 2023.

An additional application for this planned project has been approved by the ethics committee of the Helmut Schmidt University/University of the Federal Armed Forces Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany (number: 2023\\_009). The study will be performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, Good Clinical Practice principles and relevant regulations. Participation is voluntary, and a written informed consent is obtained from all participants. The socio-demographic questionnaire collects personal data (date of birth, gender, education) and two special categories of personal data (ethnic origin, health data). The principle of data minimisation is respected. All data to be collected is specifically related to the purpose of the processing and is necessary to fulfil that purpose.\nThe results of the study will only be published in peer-reviewed scientific journals in a fully anonymised form. In addition, the data will be used to write scientific qualification papers for Bachelors, Masters and Doctoral degrees. The Memory Clinic of the Nuremberg Clinic for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy will be involved in the design of the scientific articles and the recruitment of at least 10 participants. The clinic is also involved in the proofreading of the manuscript and authorship.\n\nVisual perception and cognitive functioning in MCI and mild Alzheimer's disease: a cross-sectional study protocol from the DEM-VIS study in Germany | BMJ Open\nEthics statements\nPatient consent for publication\nNot applicable.\n\nVisual perception and cognitive functioning in MCI and mild Alzheimer's disease: a cross-sectional study protocol from the DEM-VIS study in Germany | BMJ Open\nAcknowledgments\nThe studies for the newly regression-based normed SKT were supported by Dr. Willmar Schwabe Arzneimittel, Karlsruhe, Germany.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/419", "#/texts/420", "#/texts/423", "#/texts/425"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "e87c654d-3699-47ce-a7c9-ceabece7f9e2"}
