Greater understanding of the manifestation, course and relevance of clinical symptoms may help clinicians and researchers to adequately identify and monitor meaningful changes.\nClinical manifestations:\nPart I addressed bvFTD heterogeneity. In a large cohort (N=315), age at diagnosis ranged from 26-85 years. Earlier onset was associated with more severe behavioral symptoms (euphoria, apathy, depression), while later onset was characterized by more prominent memory impairment. Survival did not differ across age groups, and nearly half were diagnosed after 65, showing late-onset bvFTD is more common than assumed. Music processing emerged as a relevant domain. In a prospective study (N=63), altered music appreciation occurred in 79% of FTD patients, most often musicophilia in bvFTD (35%). These changes were independent of general emotion recognition, though bvFTD patients performed worse on music emotion recognition. Music-related phenotypes may thus represent clinical markers and potential outcome measures.\nDisease course and clinically relevant change:", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/1", "#/texts/2", "#/texts/3", "#/texts/4", "#/texts/5", "#/texts/6", "#/texts/7", "#/texts/8", "#/texts/9", "#/texts/10", "#/texts/11", "#/texts/12", "#/texts/13", "#/texts/14", "#/texts/15", "#/texts/16", "#/texts/17", "#/texts/19", "#/texts/20", "#/texts/21", "#/texts/22", "#/texts/23", "#/texts/24", "#/texts/25", "#/texts/27", "#/texts/28", "#/texts/29", "#/texts/30", "#/texts/31"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "c1efd5ea-d7a4-4a58-8253-aaac450a3659"}

Collectively, these findings refine our understanding of bvFTD progression and the social brain, and support tailored, multidimensional strategies for diagnosis, monitoring, and care.\nKW  - Disease progression\nKW  - Social cognition\nKW  - Frontotemporal dementia\nKW  - Behavioral variant\nU2  - 10.5463/thesis.1364\nDO  - 10.5463/thesis.1364\nM3  - PhD-Thesis - Research and graduation internal\nSN  - 9789465225364\nER  -\nFieldhouse JLP.\nDisease progression and social cognition in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia: Defining changes of the social brain\n. 2025. 229 p. doi: 10.5463/thesis.1364\nPowered by\nPure\n,\nScopus\n&amp;\nElsevier Fingerprint Engine\u2122", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/109", "#/texts/110", "#/texts/111", "#/texts/112", "#/texts/113", "#/texts/114", "#/texts/115", "#/texts/116", "#/texts/117", "#/texts/118", "#/texts/119", "#/texts/120", "#/texts/121", "#/texts/122", "#/texts/123", "#/texts/124", "#/texts/125", "#/texts/126", "#/texts/127", "#/texts/128", "#/texts/129"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "c147cd8f-b7e6-4186-987f-dab74bc1cbc4"}
