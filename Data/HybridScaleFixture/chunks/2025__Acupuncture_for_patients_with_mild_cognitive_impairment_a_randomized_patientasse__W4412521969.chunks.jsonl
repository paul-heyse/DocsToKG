Approximately 10-15% of patients with amnestic MCI progress to annually, with more than half experiencing AD within 5 years [\n3\n,\n4\n]. Previous epidemiological studies have reported 3-19% MCI prevalence in older adults aged\u2009&gt;\u200965 years [\n4\n]. Notably, the prevalence of dementia increases exponentially with age, doubling every 5 years after 65 years of age [\n5\n]. Detecting and managing MCI in its early stages is crucial, as MCI is a high-risk factor for developing dementia, and most individuals who visit clinics for memory disorders likely already have dementia [\n3\n].\nAcupuncture is a promising non-pharmacological treatment for cognitive impairment [\n6\n]. Acupuncture induces changes in brain areas such as the cingulate cortex, prefrontal cortex, and hippocampus in patients with MCI [\n7\n]. An overview of systematic reviews published in 2021 suggested that acupuncture may be effective for MCI and dementia [\n8\n]. A systematic review published in 2023 reported that, compared with conventional medicine or sham acupuncture, acupuncture better improved overall cognitive function in patients with MCI [\n9\n]. Recent meta-analyses have further reported the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for cognitive impairment [\n10\n] and its modulatory effects on brain regions associated with memory and cognition [\n11\n]. However, this systematic review also reported a high risk of bias in many included studies and highlighted the requirement for high-quality evidence. Additionally, a study evaluating the reporting quality of clinical trials on acupuncture for MCI revealed low to moderate quality of published reports, indicating room for improvement [\n12\n].", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/60", "#/texts/61", "#/texts/62", "#/texts/63", "#/texts/64", "#/texts/65", "#/texts/66", "#/texts/67", "#/texts/68", "#/texts/69", "#/texts/70", "#/texts/71", "#/texts/72", "#/texts/73", "#/texts/74", "#/texts/75", "#/texts/76", "#/texts/77", "#/texts/78", "#/texts/79", "#/texts/80", "#/texts/81", "#/texts/82", "#/texts/83", "#/texts/84", "#/texts/85", "#/texts/86", "#/texts/87", "#/texts/88", "#/texts/89"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "553ebd18-4395-4539-81e5-3c9171443f76"}

For the primary outcome analysis, the null hypothesis was that there would be no difference in the ADAS-cog scores between the acupuncture and sham acupuncture groups 12 weeks after baseline.

A sham-controlled acupuncture study on knee osteoarthritis that found no significant differences between groups during the treatment period revealed that the effects of real acupuncture were better maintained during the follow-up period, whereas the effects of sham acupuncture tended to return to baseline levels [\n64\n]. Owing to the pilot nature of our study and design constraints, we did not include a follow-up period. Future studies should incorporate follow-up assessments to evaluate the potential long-term benefits of acupuncture in patients with MCI.\n\nAcupuncture for patients with mild cognitive impairment: a randomized, patient-assessor-blinded, sham-controlled pilot study\nConclusion\nThis pilot, randomized, controlled trial showed promising results regarding the feasibility of conducting a large-scale clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for MCI. This study observed clinically meaningful improvements in the acupuncture and sham acupuncture groups, with a moderate effect size favoring acupuncture based on the SNSB-II memory domain T score. Adequate blinding was achieved using a non-penetrating sham acupuncture device and non-acupoint locations. However, the absence of significant differences between the groups may be attributed to the limitations of sham acupuncture, lower frequency of interventions, and small sample size. Based on the preliminary findings of this pilot trial, further confirmatory trials should be planned to test the effects of acupuncture on memory in patients with MCI.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/370", "#/texts/371", "#/texts/372", "#/texts/374"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "eec5a0eb-0918-4f18-a200-01f8799d0c8a"}
