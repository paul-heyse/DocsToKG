The total cerebral small vessel disease (tSVD) score provides a global view of CSVD burden combining lacunes of presumed vascular origin, cerebral microbleeds, enlarged perivascular spaces, and white matter hyperintensities of presumed vascular origin. While its use in research is expanding, a systematic review of the tSVD score's reliability and validity had not yet been undertaken. We reviewed the inter-rater and intra-rater reliability for the tSVD score and its features. We also examined the associations between the tSVD score and age, hypertension, stroke and cognitive impairment.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/234", "#/texts/235", "#/texts/236", "#/texts/237", "#/texts/238", "#/texts/239", "#/texts/240", "#/texts/241", "#/texts/242", "#/texts/243", "#/texts/244", "#/texts/245", "#/texts/246", "#/texts/247", "#/texts/248", "#/texts/249", "#/texts/250", "#/texts/251", "#/texts/252", "#/texts/253", "#/texts/254", "#/texts/255", "#/texts/256", "#/texts/257", "#/texts/258", "#/texts/259", "#/texts/260"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "f3482a19-c294-4255-9af3-fa2285a7bad1"}

We included manuscripts that reported at least one of the following metrics for the tSVD or for its components: inter-rater reliability, intra-rater reliability, or associations with age, hypertension, stroke, and/or cognitive impairment. We provided summary Cohen's kappa coefficients for inter and intra-rater reliability for each feature of the tSVD score. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression models were used to evaluate the impact of raters, MRI fields, age, and median tSVD score values in inter-rater reliability. We summarized studies reporting associations between the tSVD score, stroke and cognitive impairment.\nResults:\nThe summary Cohen's kappa values for inter-rater reliability ranged from 0.79 to 0.82 for each CSVD feature (13 studies, 8,177 participants). We found a high heterogeneity between studies (I\n2\n= 94%), which may be explained by differences in rater, age, and median tSVD score. The summary Cohen's kappa values for intra-rater reliability ranged from 0.78 to 0.84 (four studies, 250 cases were randomized from 3,654 participants). Heterogeneity was low. Seven studies (6,022 participants) reported associations between tSVD scores and either age or hypertension. Fifteen studies (6,941 participants) reported associations between tSVD scores and either stroke or cognitive impairment.\nConclusion:\nThe intra-rater reliability, inter-rater reliability, and construct validity of each feature of the tSVD support the use of this scale in CSVD research. However, inter-rater reliability might be influenced by rater characteristics, the median tSVD score, and participant age.\nSystematic review registration:\nhttps://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/\n, identifier CRD42022372599.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/261", "#/texts/262", "#/texts/263", "#/texts/264", "#/texts/265", "#/texts/266", "#/texts/267", "#/texts/268", "#/texts/269", "#/texts/270", "#/texts/271"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "98698ec9-9885-47f4-8cfc-ccedb067147f"}

The significant individual, social and economic burden of these conditions makes CSVD a research priority (\n2\n).\nClassical measurements of CSVD rely on visual scales for white matter hyperintensities on neuroimaging (WMH) (\n3\n). However, CSVD affects both white and gray matter, with heterogenous ischemic and hemorrhagic brain damage (\n1\n). The Standards for Reporting Vascular Changes on Neuroimaging 2 (STRIVE-2) published in 2023 reinforced the need for summary measures of distinct CSVD features (\n4\n).\nThe total cerebral small vessel disease score (tSVD score) provides a comprehensive view of CSVD (\n5\n). Raters evaluate brain magnetic resonance images (T1, T2, FLAIR, diffusion-weighted and iron-susceptibility imaging) and score 0 to 4 in an ordinal visual scale based on the presence of lacunes of presumed vascular origin (LAC), enlarged perivascular spaces (EPVS), cerebral microbleeds (CMB) and WMH of presumed vascular origin (\nFigure 1\n).\nFigure 1\nFigure 1\n. Total cerebral small vessel disease score.\nDespite its growing use in research, significant knowledge gaps remain regarding the tSVD score as a whole, as well as the performance of its individual features. First, no systematic review has yet evaluated its reliability and validity, a recommended step to ensure scientific rigor. Second, limited data exist on how the reliability of the tSVD score and its features may vary across different populations and among raters assessing SVD. Finally, further studies are needed to explore the clinical utility of the tSVD score and its features in predicting recurrent strokes across various stroke etiologies and its potential to predict dementia in diverse populations.\nWe conducted a systematic review to address the following research questions: Among adults with cerebral small vessel disease (Population), what is the reliability and validity (Outcomes) of the tSVD score and each of its features (Investigation), as assessed in observational studies (Study Design)? What factors influence the reliability of the tSVD score? What gaps exist in the current research on the reliability and validity of the tSVD score?", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/273", "#/texts/274", "#/texts/275", "#/texts/276", "#/texts/277", "#/texts/278", "#/texts/279", "#/texts/280", "#/texts/281", "#/texts/282", "#/texts/283", "#/texts/284", "#/texts/285", "#/texts/286", "#/texts/287", "#/texts/288", "#/texts/289", "#/texts/290", "#/texts/291", "#/texts/292", "#/texts/293", "#/texts/294"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "eb634f3f-34b2-443f-9e43-12ade6f5b612"}

Inter-rater agreement concerning the tSVD score or any of its features was measured by the comparison of scores from the same images by two independent raters. Intra-rater agreement was quantified on a single researcher's repeat assessment of a sample of randomly selected brain scans. The effect sizes for the inter- and intra-rater reliability were measured with the Cohen's kappa coefficient.\nValidity was defined as the extent to which the results represent what they are supposed to measure (\n8\n). Validity of the tSVD score can be demonstrated by conceptual or operational strategies. It is reasonable to assume the tSVD score is valid based on a conceptual approach, given its features were derived from an expert consensus for reporting neuroimaging of CSVD (STRIVE) (\n1\n,\n4\n). We used an operational strategy to assess construct validity, a review of the association between the tSVD score and age, hypertension, stroke and cognitive impairment. Both first-ever and recurrent strokes were considered, regardless of their causative classification. Cognitive impairment was included based on either a reported diagnosis of cognitive impairment or lower scores on screening tools such as the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) scale. The effect size for the association between tSVD score, stroke and cognitive impairment was considered if the relative risk was higher than 2 or lower than 0.5 (\n9\n).\nTwo researchers independently reviewed titles and abstracts for eligibility using the Rayyan web-tool (\n10\n).

Extracted data were compared, with any discrepancies being resolved through discussion.\nWe assessed the risk of bias with the Quality Appraisal Tool for Studies of Diagnostic Reliability (QAREL) (\n7\n). Two authors independently applied the tool to each study included for assessment of inter-rater and intra-rater reliability. A low risk of bias was considered if: (1) the samples included patients with CSVD; (2) the raters were neurologists, neuroradiologists, neurosurgeons, or radiologists; (3) the raters were blinded to the findings of other raters and to clinical information; (4) the raters assessed the same neuroimaging study; and (5) the tSVD score was applied according to the original description for each feature and summary score.\nContinuous variables were summarized as median and interquartile ranges, whereas qualitative variables were described in percentages and total counts.

Cohen's kappa's values for inter and intra-rater agreements were substantial or almost perfect for WMH, LAC, CMB, and EPVS. The type of rater, age, and median score moderated the inter-rater reliability of the tSVD score. Age, hypertension, stroke, and cognitive impairment were linked to higher tSVD scores.\nThe use of highly reliable scores decreases the risk of type 2 errors (\n43\n). We classified the estimate Cohen's kappa values as substantial or almost perfect for all of the features of the tSVD score. However, the reliability of a score depends on its raters. Notably, the raters in the studies reviewed were trained neuroradiologists, neurologists, neurosurgeons or radiologists. The statistical heterogeneity was lower in studies where tSVD scores were assessed exclusively by neuroradiologists. This finding highlights the influence of raters on tSVD reproducibility and underscores the potential need for standardized training on its application. All tSVD features were highly reliable, but the absence of studies reporting the intra- and inter-rater reliability of the total SVD score and the lack of individual-patient data limited the calculation of a summary reliability measure for the total SVD score. Future studies assessing the reliability of the tSVD score should report not only the reliability of each individual features but also the reliability of the overall tSVD score.\nOur review primarily included studies from Asia, the United States, and Europe, with only a few from Latin America and none from Africa. It is crucial to validate the tSVD score across diverse populations, as ethnic differences in CSVD burden have been observed. Compared to Caucasians, Asians may have a higher prevalence of WMH (\n44\n), while MRIs from African American and Latin American subjects (\n45\n,\n46\n) show a greater burden of CMB. Older age was associated with higher inter-rater reliability of the CMB in this study, but not the inter-rater reliability of other features of the tSVD score.

Other features may be important for non-arteriosclerosis causes of CSVD. Superficial siderosis, for instance, is relevant to evaluate the burden of cerebral amyloid angiopathy but is not included in the tSVD score (\n49\n). The tSVD score does not consider differences in the distribution of CSVD lesions among causes of CSVD. For example, in cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), WMH affect the extreme capsule and anterior temporal poles, uncommon in other causes of CSVD (\n50\n). All studies in the inter-rater and intra-rater analyses focused on populations with arteriolosclerosis as the primary cause of CSVD, restricting reliability and validity assessment to sporadic SVD.\nThe reliabilities of all tSVD features were substantial or almost perfect, while reliabilities of the periventricular and deep Fazekas scale were substantial (\n51\n). The tSVD score addresses the limitations of current methods for assessing CSVD burden on brain MRI. While the Fazekas scale addresses only WMH (\n51\n), the tSVD score integrates multiple CSVD markers - LAC, CMB, and EPVS.\nThe tSVD score provides a simple and practical measure of CSVD burden on brain MRI, in contrast with automatic segmentation tools that may offer greater precision but necessitates additional imaging acquisitions and processing (\n52\n).

Another adaptation incorporates centrum semiovale EPVS and cortical superficial siderosis, both of which correlate with pathological evidence of amyloid angiopathy (\n49\n). Other modifications include raising the EPVS threshold and refining the scoring for microbleeds and WMH burden based on their count and severity (\n54\n). This study focused on the original tSVD score, and future research should examine how its ongoing adaptations may affect the tool's reliability and validity.\nThis meta-analysis relied solely on aggregated data; therefore, individual patient data were not available to assess other neuroimaging patterns of CSVD. Future studies in the field of CSVD should evaluate the tSVD score in subjects with non-atherosclerotic causes of CSVD, as well as its responsiveness to change over time.\nThe present study was limited to the two most used properties of a neuroimaging score: validity and reliability. Another relevant characteristic - responsiveness to change (\n55\n) - was not evaluated. Responsiveness to change is a concern for the tSVD score because LAC and CMB are scored according to their presence rather than their number. Hence, the tSVD score may carry a potential risk of a ceiling effect, as an increase in the number of LAC or CMB might not lead to a corresponding increase in the score. Moreover, the results of this systematic review suggest that higher median tSVD scores may be linked to higher inter-rater agreement for CMB. The tSVD score might be limited in at the extremes of the CSVD burden.\nNo longitudinal studies evaluating successive tSVD scores over time and its association with clinical symptoms were identified. Future longitudinal studies, particularly those leveraging big data and open science, should assess changes in the tSVD score over time and evaluate the impact of its increase on stroke and dementia risk.
