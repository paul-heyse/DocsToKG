Accumulating evidence indicates that T2DM is linked to declines in multiple cognitive domains, which may progress to cognitive impairment or even dementia. This cognitive impairment arises from complex interactions among insulin resistance, chronic inflammatory responses, vascular injury and microangiopathy and oxidative stress. Clinical studies suggest that strict glycemic control combined with behavioral and lifestyle interventions may delay cognitive decline, though their long-term efficacy requires further evidence-based validation. Future research should leverage multi-omics technologies to identify early biomarkers for T2DM-related cognitive impairment, elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms, identify specific therapeutic targets, and develop personalized intervention strategies. This review systematically examines the epidemiological correlations, pathophysiological mechanisms, and advances in clinical management of T2DM-related cognitive disorders, with the aim of providing a theoretical foundation for early prevention and targeted treatment.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/216", "#/texts/217", "#/texts/218", "#/texts/219", "#/texts/220", "#/texts/221", "#/texts/222", "#/texts/223", "#/texts/224", "#/texts/225", "#/texts/226", "#/texts/227", "#/texts/228"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "9ce840b2-1811-4be2-a96e-ebaced875853"}

Global prevalence of T2DM is expected to increase to 7,079 cases per 100,000 population by 2030, reflecting a sustained upward trend across all regions (\n1\n). T2DM significantly elevates the risk of microvascular complications (e.g., retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy) and macrovascular diseases (e.g., coronary artery disease, stroke) (\n2\n). Cognitive impairment is defined as a decline in one or more cognitive domains, including memory, attention, orientation, judgment, and problem-solving abilities (\n3\n). Manifestations of impairment may include slowed information processing, memory deficits, and challenges in learning or decision-making (\n4\n). Cognitive impairment severely impacts overall well-being by compromising social engagement and functional independence, increasing reliance on caregivers while reducing autonomy, and posing safety risks, ultimately elevating morbidity and mortality rates through diminished self-care capacity and delayed medical intervention (\n3\n,\n5\n). Given the escalating global prevalence of T2DM and its profound implications for cognitive health, elucidating the underlying pathophysiological pathways and identifying preventive interventions are critical for mitigating dual disease burdens. Research in this domain holds significant clinical and societal relevance. Understanding how metabolic dysregulation accelerates neurodegenerative processes could inform early biomarkers for cognitive risk stratification and targeted therapies.

IR refers to diminished responsiveness of peripheral tissues (e.g., skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, liver) to insulin signaling, glucose uptake into these cells becomes inefficient, resulting in its accumulation in the bloodstream and consequent hyperglycemia. To compensate, pancreatic \u03b2-cells augment insulin secretion, leading to a state of hyperinsulinemia. These defects mutually reinforce each other, establishing a vicious cycle. Chronic inflammation, ectopic lipid deposition, endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS), and oxidative stress further exacerbate metabolic dysregulation by impairing insulin sensitivity and/or \u03b2-cell function, thereby driving the onset and progression of T2DM and its target organ damage (TOD) (\n6\n).\n\u03b2-cells integrate signals from glucose, free fatty acids (FFA), hormones (e.g., incretins GLP-1/GIP), and neural inputs to dynamically regulate insulin secretion (\n7\n).

Chronic vascular occlusion disrupts central hemodynamics, cerebral perfusion, and cerebrovascular function. Key functional impairments include: endothelial-dependent vasodilation deficits and impaired cerebrovascular autoregulation (\n11\n,\n12\n). These dysfunctions directly manifest as abnormal cerebral blood flow (CBF) (\n13\n). Evidence linking carotid AS to cerebral atrophy suggests that sustained CBF reduction contributes to brain volume loss, a recognized precursor to vascular dementia (VD). Moreover, Chronic hypoperfusion exacerbates neuroinflammation by activating microglia, leading to white matter lesions (WMLs) and neurodegeneration.

Wu et al. reported that DR is associated with psychomotor slowing and attentional deficits. Electrophysiological studies in diabetic models demonstrate reduced neuronal activity in the primary visual cortex, impairing visual information processing (\n14\n). Meta-analytic evidence further links retinal pathology to cognitive decline, any retinopathy was significantly associated with the presence of dementia and cognitive deficits, as well as with reduced processing speed (\n15\n).These associations persist even in patients without overt retinopathy, suggesting that retinal microvascular changes (e.g., altered vessel caliber, fractal dimension) may serve as biomarkers of cerebral microangiopathy and neurodegeneration.

Clinical studies reveal a bidirectional relationship between renal dysfunction and cognitive impairment, where elevated urinary albumin excretion rate (UAER) predicts poorer cognitive performance, while declining glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is associated with worsening cognitive scores, highlighting a dose-dependent link between renal impairment and neurodegeneration (\n16\n). DKD contributes to cognitive impairment through interconnected pathophysiological pathways. Impaired renal clearance of uremic toxins, such as indoxyl sulfate, promotes neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, accelerating BBB disruption and neuronal apoptosis (\n17\n). These mechanisms synergistically disrupt neurovascular homeostasis, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in diabetic patients. Serum creatinine, an indicator of renal dysfunction, inversely correlates with cognitive performance in elderly diabetic populations, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker for cognitive decline, while early detection of DKD through measures like UAER monitoring can help stratify dementia risk and guide interventions, such as renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, to preserve both renal and cognitive function (\n18\n).", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/276", "#/texts/277", "#/texts/278", "#/texts/279", "#/texts/280", "#/texts/281", "#/texts/282"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "50f9ae41-46e6-4ea1-800e-07f2d1b5c613"}

Evidence demonstrates that individuals with T2DM and DPN exhibit lower global cognitive performance compared to those without DPN, including deficits in memory, attention, and psychomotor speed (\n19\n). In type 1 diabetes, cognitive impairment is similarly pronounced, with DPN patients showing marked impairments in attention, visuospatial/executive functions, language, and abstract reasoning (\n20\n). Notably, painful DPN correlates with more severe cognitive deficits than painless DPN (\n21\n), particularly in domains of attention and memory.

Insulin signaling in the brain is essential for normal cognitive function, particularly in key regions such as the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (\n25\n), where it regulates glucose utilization, energy homeostasis, synaptogenesis and long-term potentiation (LTP). It also governs appetite regulation and systemic metabolic balance (\n26\n). Brain insulin resistance (BIR) is recognized as a key factor linking metabolic disorders like obesity and T2DM to cognitive decline. It disrupts normal insulin signaling pathways, leading to mitochondrial structural and functional abnormalities, which in turn result in impaired energy metabolism and increased oxidative stress. This dysfunction triggers neuronal damage and cognitive deterioration, ultimately contributing to cognitive impairment (\n27\n).\nBIR reduces plasma levels of neurotrophic factors such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (\n28\n), which plays a critical role in promoting structural and functional plasticity in the central nervous system (CNS) (\n29\n). Additionally, BIR downregulates the expression of neuronal glucose transporters (e.g., GLUT4), impairing cerebral glucose uptake (\n30\n).

Chi et al. discovered that plasma NDEs from T2DM patients showed significantly reduced levels of mitochondrial complex I protein NDUFS3 and complex II protein SDHB. Lower SDHB levels were positively correlated with progression from MCI to AD (\n86\n). Specific miRNAs and proteins in NDEs, including but not limited to miR-185-5p, miR-132-3p, and miR-34a-5p (\n87\n-\n89\n), have been linked to AD and cognitive impairment, highlighting their biomarker potential.\nElevated myo-inositol (MI) concentrations coupled with reduced glutamate (Glu), Glx (glutamate + glutamine), and NAA/Cr (N-acetylaspartate/creatine) ratios within the hippocampus represent sensitive metabolic biomarkers for monitoring diabetic cognitive impairment progression (\n90\n). Additional metabolic biomarkers under consideration include C-reactive protein, tau protein, BDNF and AGEs (\n91\n).", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/499", "#/texts/500", "#/texts/501", "#/texts/502", "#/texts/503", "#/texts/504", "#/texts/505", "#/texts/506", "#/texts/507", "#/texts/508", "#/texts/509", "#/texts/510", "#/texts/511", "#/texts/512", "#/texts/513"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "fcf8e6a1-aae1-4c1e-bfef-6da71fe75606"}

High-resolution MRI segmentation analyses have demonstrated significant volumetric reductions in memory-critical hippocampal subfields (CA1, dentate gyrus [DG], and subiculum) among middle-aged T2DM patients. These specific subregions are known to be fundamentally involved in memory encoding and consolidation processes. These structurally measured hippocampal subfield atrophies not only directly correlated with cognitive performance but may also reflect persistent neural damage caused by glucose metabolic dysregulation. Importantly, these findings provide neuroimaging evidence for early identification of high-risk populations (\n93\n).\nIn newly diagnosed T2DM patients, elevated venular tortuosity shows significant association with cognitive impairment. This correlation remained significant after adjustment for multiple demographic and health factors, suggesting retinal vascular tortuosity may serve as an early indicator of cognitive decline (\n94\n). Retinal vascular metrics (RVMs) can function as imaging biomarkers to predict cognitive impairment in T2DM, thereby enhancing risk stratification (\n95\n). Furthermore, patients with T2DM and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) exhibit significant thinning of the macular retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and ganglion cell layer (GCL) (\n96\n). These structural changes can be effectively quantified through\nin vivo\noptical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging, highlighting the potential of retinal assessment for predicting diabetes-related cognitive dysfunction (\n97\n).\nThe complexity of T2DM-related cognitive dysfunction involves multiple pathways and contributing factors, necessitating a multi-faceted approach to biomarker discovery. Future research should prioritize validation of these biomarkers in larger longitudinal cohorts and explore their potential for guiding personalized therapeutic strategies.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/514", "#/texts/515", "#/texts/516", "#/texts/517", "#/texts/518", "#/texts/519", "#/texts/520", "#/texts/521", "#/texts/522", "#/texts/523", "#/texts/524", "#/texts/525", "#/texts/526", "#/texts/527", "#/texts/528", "#/texts/529", "#/texts/530"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "0160e00a-92d7-410a-92a5-41deb1193be9"}

Mechanisms including insulin resistance, chronic inflammation, vascular injury, and oxidative stress collectively drive disease progression. Effective glycemic control not only mitigates metabolic dysregulation but also exerts protective effects on cognitive function. Concurrently, factors such as age, educational attainment, and socioeconomic determinants play pivotal roles in disease development, thereby providing new perspectives for multidimensional intervention strategies. Furthermore, the discovery of novel biomarkers and early detection technologies offers promising avenues for early screening and disease monitoring.\nThese findings hold significant implications for both clinical practice and public health: On the one hand, they underscore the necessity for early cognitive assessment and integrated management in T2DM patients; On the other hand, they emphasize the importance of establishing social support systems to reduce cognitive risk in high-risk populations. However, current research still has limitations, such as small sample sizes in longitudinal cohort studies, incomplete understanding of mechanistic differences across diverse ethnic groups, and the need for further validation of newly identified biomarkers in clinical translation.\nFuture research could focus on leveraging multi-omics technologies to explore novel pathogenic mechanisms, conducting long-term, multicenter, cross-cultural cohort studies to clarify the universality of risk factors, and developing early warning models based on emerging biomarkers. There is also an urgent need to explore personalized comprehensive treatment strategies that integrate metabolic regulation and social interventions, thereby providing a more robust theoretical and practical foundation for improving cognitive health in patients with T2DM.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/532", "#/texts/533", "#/texts/534"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "3a8b8ea8-c853-4270-9063-4fc1fe07cc77"}
