Older individuals often present with atypical or nonspecific symptoms when experiencing common health issues, which can complicate diagnosis and treatment [\n1\n,\n2\n]. This is particularly true in older adults living in nursing homes, where frailty, comorbidities, and cognitive decline are prevalent. Nonspecific symptoms, such as confusion or fatigue, may obscure the underlying cause of illness, leading to potential misdiagnosis [\n3\n,\n4\n].\nFurthermore, the rising prevalence of antibiotic resistance has prompted a critical review of how antibiotics are used, particularly in the care of older adults in nursing homes [\n5\n]. As such, there is a growing need to understand and explore other potential explanations for these nonspecific symptoms in this vulnerable population.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/48", "#/texts/49", "#/texts/51", "#/texts/52", "#/texts/53", "#/texts/54", "#/texts/55", "#/texts/56", "#/texts/57", "#/texts/58", "#/texts/59", "#/texts/60", "#/texts/61", "#/texts/62"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "ecedfe32-13ac-4b7c-a605-66c80294e548"}

This practice increases the risk of selecting antibiotic-resistant bacteria. UTIs are more prevalent among women in nursing homes [\n3\n]. According to international consensus, even in older residents in nursing homes, symptoms from the lower urinary tract should be present to diagnose acute cystitis [\n6\n,\n7\n,\n8\n]. Despite this, few patients treated for suspected UTIs in nursing homes actually exhibit lower urinary tract symptoms [\n9\n,\n10\n]. The diagnosis is instead based on nonspecific symptoms, which are not specific to the urinary tract, such as confusion, restlessness, fatigue, agitation, reduced appetite, tendency to fall, or a sense of not being oneself [\n11\n,\n12\n,\n13\n]. Given the growing problem of antibiotic-resistant bacteria it is important to avoid unnecessary antibiotic use [\n5\n]. Therefore, it is important to investigate alternative explanations for these nonspecific symptoms. Vitamin D deficiency is common among older adults living in nursing homes [\n14\n,\n15\n,\n16\n] and is associated with risk of falls [\n17\n].

However, there was no association between these long-lasting nonspecific symptoms and vitamin D deficiency.\nThe intensity of nonspecific symptoms typically varies over time, and during episodes of increased severity nurses often misinterpret these symptoms as acute cystitis. Additionally, since 25OHD concentrations fluctuate slowly over time and potential deficiencies develop gradually, there is greater likelihood of them being associated with symptoms persisting for an extended period. Based on this reasoning, and according to the pre-specified statistical analysis plan, we analyzed long-lasting nonspecific symptoms persisting \u2265\u20093 months instead of symptoms of shorter duration. Exploratively, we also carried out the analysis with a cut-off for nonspecific symptoms lasting \u2265\u20091 month. Also with this duration cut-off there was no association between nonspecific symptoms and vitamin D concentrations.\nThe median concentration of vitamin D and interquartile ranges were similar across groups (Table\n1\n). In the regression analysis (Table\n2\n), vitamin D was treated as a continuous variable. This approach allows to maximize the use of all available data points, while adjusting for confounders like dementia (Table\n2\n). An alternative method of categorizing vitamin D levels into predefined cut-off values would result in a loss of data granularity. For this reason, vitamin D was treated as a continuous variable. Given that none of the\np\n-values in Table\n2\nwere close to statistical significance and that the median values between groups were similar (Table\n1\n), it is unlikely that dividing the data into categorical cut-offs would yield a different result.

Case report forms and blood samples were collected from 60% (545/901) of all registered residents in the nursing homes (Fig.\n1\n). While 60% participation may seem low it is consistent with previous studies conducted in nursing homes [\n14\n]. It is challenging to include frail older adult research participants in nursing homes and collect blood samples. A large proportion have dementia, and when the research participants cannot provide informed consent, according to ethical regulations, relatives must be contacted, informed, and asked if they do not oppose participation by their relative in the study.\nFig. 1\nAnother strength is that we adjusted for dementia, in which nonspecific symptoms are common. There may be differences between the groups with and without dementia. Therefore, we used dementia as an independent variable in the regression analysis. As expected, confusion was more common in individuals with dementia, with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.6 (95% CI 1.1-1.2),\np\n= 0.011 (Table\n2\n).\nVitamin D deficiency is also more common among older adults living in nursing homes suffering from dementia, compared to older adults without dementia [\n18\n,\n19\n,\n20\n,\n21\n]. There were more women than men in this study which reflects the gender distribution among older adults living in nursing homes. In the logistic regressions we also adjusted for gender. Despite adjusting for confounders there is potential for residual confounding.\nA weakness may be that nurses themselves had to determine whether residents had any of the nonspecific symptoms, as validated instruments were not used for this purpose. However, this is also a strength because the symptoms registered by nurses in this study were evaluated in the same way as by nurses in clinical practice. With or without dementia, individuals with nonspecific symptoms, such as confusion, may be unable to articulate their symptoms.

In consideration of a population where the average age is constantly rising and life expectancy increasing, it is important to study factors that affect the health of older adults.\n\nAre long-lasting nonspecific symptoms related to vitamin D deficiency among older adults living in nursing homes?\nConclusions\nNonspecific symptoms persisting \u2265\u20093 months and vitamin D deficiency were common among older adults living in nursing homes. However, there was no association between these long-lasting nonspecific symptoms and vitamin D concentrations. Although there was no association, valuable information is still contributed to the ongoing research on vitamin D and older adults.\n\nAre long-lasting nonspecific symptoms related to vitamin D deficiency among older adults living in nursing homes?\nData availability\nThe data supporting the conclusions of this study can be obtained from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/206", "#/texts/207", "#/texts/208", "#/texts/209", "#/texts/210", "#/texts/211", "#/texts/212", "#/texts/213", "#/texts/214", "#/texts/215", "#/texts/216", "#/texts/217", "#/texts/218", "#/texts/219", "#/texts/220", "#/texts/221", "#/texts/222", "#/texts/223", "#/texts/224", "#/texts/225", "#/texts/226", "#/texts/227", "#/texts/228", "#/texts/229", "#/texts/230", "#/texts/231", "#/texts/232", "#/texts/233", "#/texts/234", "#/texts/235", "#/texts/236", "#/texts/237", "#/texts/238", "#/texts/240", "#/texts/242"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "df2a26ad-5786-4356-8089-bc51f202d4b3"}
