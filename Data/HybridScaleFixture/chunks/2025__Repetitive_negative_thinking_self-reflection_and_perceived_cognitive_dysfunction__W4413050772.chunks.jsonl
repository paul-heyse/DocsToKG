With the growing prevalence of these disorders, it is essential to identify and understand potential factors that maintain cognitive function and potentially delay severe cognitive dysfunction. This study examined the roles of repetitive negative thinking (RNT) and reflection in subjective cognitive dysfunction among older adults, with an additional consideration of their association with depressive symptoms. RNT, which is common in depression, has been associated with cognitive impairments. However, its unique influence on cognitive dysfunction is unclear. Conversely, reflection, considered to protect against adverse cognitive outcomes, is less explored. Using the Rumination Response Scale (RRS), we hypothesize that RNT may be more strongly linked to cognitive dysfunction than reflection, even when controlling for depressive symptoms. Two-hundred and seventy-six older adults (137 male, 139 female) from Japan participated in the study, providing measures of RRS-brooding (an index of RNT), RRS-reflection (an index of reflection), depressive symptoms, and self-reported cognitive dysfunction. The results showed higher reflection, but not RNT, was associated with greater subjective cognitive dysfunction [\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.28,\np\n=.03], even after controlling for depressive symptoms. Importantly, the association between reflection and cognitive dysfunction demonstrated sex differences, with reflection significantly accounting for cognitive dysfunction in female [\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.46,\np\n=.01] but not in male. These findings highlight the significance of evaluating specific subtypes of repetitive thoughts and sex differences when investigating the association with perceived cognitive dysfunction. Future research should continue to explore the mechanisms underlying these associations and the prevention and treatment of cognitive dysfunctions.\nPeer Review reports", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/40", "#/texts/41", "#/texts/42", "#/texts/43", "#/texts/44", "#/texts/45"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "41e462c9-17b3-444a-8d51-47cbdef9b17d"}

For example, Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and other forms of dementia are major contributors of neurological causes of death and disabilities worldwide, with the absolute number of affected individuals continually rising [\n1\n]. Although new disease-modifying treatments have shown promise in slowing cognitive decline in early-stage AD, their long-term efficacy, safety, and accessibility remain limited [\n2\n,\n3\n,\n4\n,\n5\n]. Consequently, there is an urgent need to identify risk factors and understand their mechanisms, potentially enabling therapeutic strategies that maintain cognitive function and potentially delay the onset of severe cognitive dysfunction.\nA key area of interest that has been implicated in cognitive health research is the effect of repetitive thinking, a cognitive style characterized by recurring thoughts that can manifest in both adaptive and maladaptive forms [\n6\n]. Repetitive thinking encompasses various types, including repetitive negative thinking (RNT) and self-reflection [\n7\n,\n8\n]. RNT, such as worry and rumination, is characterized by persistent thoughts that revolve around negative themes [\n9\n], and has been linked to impaired memory and executive function across diverse populations [\n10\n,\n11\n,\n12\n,\n13\n,\n14\n,\n15\n,\n16\n,\n17\n]. Furthermore, Marchant and colleagues utilized amyloid-positron emission tomography (PET) and tau-PET scans to identify the association between RNT and cognitive dysfunction, as well as neuropathological markers of AD [\n18\n]. These findings implicate RNT as a potential pathway contributing to the increased risk of cognitive impairment and dementia. Additionally, since RNT is a central feature of depression and depressive symptoms have been shown to contribute to cognitive dysfunction [\n19\n], the need to understand the complex interplay between RNT, depression, and cognitive health is imperative. Some of the existing studies on RNT and cognitive function have adjusted for depression, while others have not (see review 12). This inconsistency, which strengthens the argument for further exploration of the independent role of RNT in cognitive dysfunction.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/47", "#/texts/48", "#/texts/49", "#/texts/50", "#/texts/51", "#/texts/52", "#/texts/53", "#/texts/54", "#/texts/55", "#/texts/56", "#/texts/57", "#/texts/58", "#/texts/59", "#/texts/60", "#/texts/61", "#/texts/62", "#/texts/63", "#/texts/64", "#/texts/65", "#/texts/66", "#/texts/67", "#/texts/68", "#/texts/69", "#/texts/70", "#/texts/71", "#/texts/72", "#/texts/73", "#/texts/74", "#/texts/75", "#/texts/76", "#/texts/77", "#/texts/78", "#/texts/79", "#/texts/80", "#/texts/81", "#/texts/82", "#/texts/83", "#/texts/84", "#/texts/85", "#/texts/86"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "3f4bd8cd-da91-4259-8d62-b52c050158cf"}

However, while brooding (as a measure of RNT) and reflection (as a measure of self-reflection) are often measured together using the total score of the Rumination Response Scale (RRS; 21), there is increasing evidence that these constructs are associated with different cognitive and psychological outcomes [\n10\n]. Brooding involves a passive comparison of one's current situation with unachieved standards (e.g., \"think about a recent situation, wishing it had gone better), while reflection is characterized by purposeful introspection aimed at cognitive problem-solving to alleviate depressive symptoms (e.g., \"analyze your personality to try to understand why you are depressed\"; 22). Although both cognitive styles share a common aspect as perseverative repetitive thinking; however, RNT focuses on the negative valance and tends to exacerbate cognitive dysfunction, while reflection may support cognitive resilience by enhancing problem-solving and promoting emotional regulation. For example, studies have demonstrated that engaging in reflective self-analysis is associated with improved executive functioning and reduced cognitive decline in older adults [\n20\n,\n23\n,\n24\n]. Additionally, reflection has been linked to greater neural plasticity and the maintenance of cognitive flexibility, which are crucial for cognitive health across the lifespan [\n25\n,\n26\n]. Future research should aim to disentangle the differential effects of these cognitive styles on cognitive trajectories and determine whether interventions that promote self-reflective practices can mitigate the cognitive risks associated with RNT and aging [\n17\n,\n27\n]. The association between these cognitive styles and cognitive impairment requires further exploration. In addition, previous studies have consistently reported that sex plays a distinct role in the contribution to RNT and cognitive dysfunction [\n28\n,\n29\n,\n30\n,\n31\n,\n32\n,\n33\n,\n34\n].

Consistent with our hypothesis, higher levels of RNT were associated with greater subjective cognitive dysfunction, independent of the contribution of depressive symptoms. In contrast, reflection did not exhibit a protective effect in general. However, it moderated the relationship between RNT and cognitive dysfunction, particularly when levels of reflection were below-average. This finding suggests that reflection alone may not be sufficient to buffer against the negative effects of RNT unless it is at an adequate level to facilitate effective problem-solving and emotional regulation. Theoretical frameworks support the observed associations between cognitive styles and cognitive dysfunction. Research on attention and memory biases in depression reveals consistent patterns across currently depressed, formerly depressed, and never-depressed individuals. Currently and formerly depressed individuals show attentional biases towards negative stimuli and away from positive stimuli [\n27\n]. RNT can act as a perseverative cognitive process that disrupts cognitive functioning by occupying cognitive resources and contributing to heightened emotional distress [\n42\n]. This aligns with our findings that higher levels of RNT are linked to greater cognitive dysfunction. Similarly, Zainal and Newman (2022) build on these ideas by proposing that the relationship between cognitive dysfunction and psychopathology symptoms, such as anxiety and depression, is bidirectional and complex [\n17\n]. Their review supports both vulnerability and scar theories, where cognitive dysfunction can both precede and result from anxiety-related symptoms. The observed associations in our study suggest that maladaptive forms of RNT, which may lead to cognitive overload and reduced cognitive efficiency, could contribute to subjective cognitive dysfunction [\n43\n]. Furthermore, our findings are consistent with the work of Sharp, Miller, and Heller (2015), who describe how transdiagnostic factors such as anxious apprehension and anxious arousal can influence executive function across multiple disorders [\n16", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/210", "#/texts/211", "#/texts/212", "#/texts/213", "#/texts/214", "#/texts/215", "#/texts/216", "#/texts/217", "#/texts/218", "#/texts/219"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "6a581977-5a6e-40a8-8070-3ee842b46e30"}

These transdiagnostic factors are known to interact with executive function and cognitive styles, potentially amplifying the effects of RNT on cognitive health. These research suggest that RNT and reflection, when engaged in excessively, may disrupt cognitive processes that are crucial for maintaining cognitive flexibility and problem-solving abilities. This helps explain why reflection, although typically considered adaptive, did not exhibit a protective effect in our study and was instead associated with cognitive dysfunction at low levels. Notably, sex differences emerged, with the relationship between cognitive styles and cognitive dysfunction being more pronounced in males, while neither brooding nor reflection contributed to cognitive dysfunction in females beyond the influence of depression severity. These results suggest that males may be more vulnerable to the negative effects of RNT, especially when they lack adaptive self-reflective strategies. These findings suggest that the interplay between cognitive styles and cognitive health is more complex than previously understood.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/220"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "1afdf816-513d-4cda-b0c3-03ab927608b6"}

Importantly, this study expands on previous work by examining the association between RNT, reflection, and cognitive dysfunction, going beyond depression alone. Previous studies have suggested that RNT may be a potential pathway contributing to the increased risk of AD [\n10\n,\n11\n,\n12\n,\n13\n,\n14\n], while reflection could potentially serve as a protective factor against dementia [\n20\n]. The current study, however, found that reflection significantly explained the subjective cognitive dysfunction in addition to depression severity. One might argue that, given the strong link between depression and RNT, RNT may not independently account for cognitive impairment beyond depression, while reflection does. However, both reflection and RNT demonstrated a relatively strong correlation with depressive symptoms (reflection:\nr\n=.57,\np\nr\n=.65,\np\nS1\n), which highlights the distinctive role of reflection in subjective cognitive dysfunction. Although both RNT and reflection are forms of persistent and repetitive thoughts, the relationship between reflection, depressive symptoms, and cognitive dysfunction is less well-defined. Contradictory findings suggest that reflection does not always serve as an adaptive coping strategy [\n44\n,\n45\n]. This could suggest the existence of a threshold beyond which reflection ceases to be beneficial and begins to contribute to cognitive dysfunction. Another interpretation for this counterintuitive association between reflection and subjective cognitive dysfunction could be a self-preservation mechanism [\n46\n,\n47\n]. Individuals experiencing more pronounced subjective cognitive decline might engage more in reflection, stemming from a belief that active mental engagement and contemplative thoughts are essential to maintain cognitive function and daily activity [\n46\n]. Additionally, it is possible that older adults with subjective cognitive dysfunction might have a response bias towards reporting higher levels of reflection due to increased concern about their cognitive abilities [\n47\n]. However, the directionality of the relationship between reflection and cognitive dysfunction remains unclear due to this study's cross-sectional nature.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/221", "#/texts/222", "#/texts/223", "#/texts/224", "#/texts/225", "#/texts/226", "#/texts/227", "#/texts/228", "#/texts/229", "#/texts/230", "#/texts/231", "#/texts/232", "#/texts/233", "#/texts/234", "#/texts/235", "#/texts/236", "#/texts/238", "#/texts/239", "#/texts/240", "#/texts/242", "#/texts/243", "#/texts/244", "#/texts/245", "#/texts/246", "#/texts/247", "#/texts/248", "#/texts/249", "#/texts/250", "#/texts/251", "#/texts/252", "#/texts/253", "#/texts/254", "#/texts/255"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "442831a1-dc8d-4623-80b5-fda3e05a0ba7"}

Additionally, the study found that the effect of reflection on cognitive decline varies between female and male. This indicates that there may be divergent underlying mechanisms of dementia in different sexes. This finding is consistent with previous studies that have shown a higher risk of developing AD in female compared to male [\n48\n] and that the apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, the most significant known genetic risk factor for dementia, has a greater deleterious effect on hippocampus and memory performance in female than for male [\n49\n]. The findings of this study contribute to the understanding of potential risk factors and inform considerations for developing interventions aimed at supporting brain health and possibly delaying dementia symptoms.\nGiven that males appear to be more negatively influenced by RNT, interventions targeting maladaptive RNT, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), could be particularly effective in this group [\n50\n]. These interventions could focus on enhancing reflective capacities to promote adaptive reflection and reduce the detrimental effects of RNT. For females, the stronger association between depressive symptoms and cognitive dysfunction suggests that interventions targeting mood-related symptoms may be more beneficial for cognitive health [\n51\n]. Moreover, future research should investigate whether sex-specific interventions that take into account these cognitive styles can optimize treatment outcomes. For instance, incorporating elements of reflection training into existing therapeutic frameworks could be evaluated for its potential to enhance cognitive resilience, particularly in males [\n50\n].\nOverall, the findings of this study underscore the need to consider sex differences when designing and implementing cognitive health interventions. Tailoring interventions based on these differences could lead to more effective strategies for mitigating cognitive decline in older adults and enhancing quality of life. Furthermore, the results suggest that future studies should explore the complex interplay between cognitive styles, sex differences, and cognitive health across diverse populations and cultural contexts to develop a more comprehensive understanding of these relationships.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/256", "#/texts/257", "#/texts/258", "#/texts/259", "#/texts/260", "#/texts/261", "#/texts/262", "#/texts/263", "#/texts/264", "#/texts/265", "#/texts/266", "#/texts/267", "#/texts/268"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "f4cd4144-223e-4bd7-b926-5e224e423d9c"}

Firstly, the data was originally collected to investigate hoarding disorders in Japanese older adults, and cognitive dysfunction was not the primary focus of the project. Cognitive function was measured via self-reported cognitive function inventories, which reflect participants' own perception of their cognitive functions compared to their past experiences and may be biased based on subjective experience and individual standard. Future studies need to control potential biases and implement objective measures of cognitive functions, such as the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB), which are commonly used to assess cognitive impairments, including those seen in dementia. Secondly, the participants in this study were recruited via e-mail invitation, which naturally excludes older adults who have no access to the internet or limited technology skills. Future replication should utilize traditional recruiting methods such as phone calls to ensure a more representative sample. Thirdly, the focus of this study was on past-oriented repetitive thinking. Since both rumination (past-oriented) and worry (future-oriented) are included in the transdiagnostic concept of RNT, the current findings cannot address whether and to what extent worry could explain cognitive function dysfunction in older adults. Future studies should include inventories targeting worry, such as the Penn State Worry Questionnaire, to explore this possibility. Fourth, the current study design was cross-sectional, which means that the directionality and causality between reflection and cognitive dysfunction remain uncertain. To establish a causal relationship, future research should incorporate experimental methods in its study design. Finally, it is important to note that the mean scores for depressive symptoms (PHQ-9: M\u2009=", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/269"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "4f212fdf-ea64-41dc-b3bf-67867f875f2a"}

While this could suggest that threshold effects (i.e., only high levels of depression or RNT contributing to cognitive dysfunction) are not relevant to our findings, it also highlights the sensitivity of our measures in detecting associations between cognitive styles and cognitive dysfunction even at subclinical levels. Furthermore, the relatively low levels of RNT and reflection suggest that even mild or moderate engagement in these cognitive styles can have detectable effects on cognitive health, underscoring the need to examine these relationships in populations with varying levels of cognitive styles and psychological symptoms. The current findings thus demonstrate that threshold effects may not fully explain the effect of brooding on cognitive dysfunction in this sample, as significant associations were observed despite the generally low levels of brooding and depressive symptoms. Future research should further explore this by including participants with a broader range of symptom severity to determine whether threshold effects or dose-response relationships are evident in more diverse samples. Overall, the results indicate that cognitive styles like RNT can exert an influence on cognitive function across a range of severity levels, highlighting the importance of early identification and intervention even before symptoms reach clinical thresholds.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/269"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "6a859468-4c72-4411-baaf-f8298361ebb1"}

Most existing research has been conducted in Western European and North American countries, which may limit the generalizability of these findings. Cultural values and norms can shape how individuals engage in RNT and reflection. Research suggests that people from collectivistic cultures, such as those in East Asian countries, may engage in these cognitive styles differently compared to those from individualistic cultures, such as Western European countries. For example, in Japan, both brooding and self-reflection were associated with a history of depression, indicating that these cognitive styles may not always have a protective effect [\n52\n]. Cross-cultural comparisons also show variability in how different cognitive and emotional regulation strategies are used. For instance, Korean individuals were found to engage in RNT more frequently than American individuals, while Americans reported higher levels of anger suppression. These differences suggest that culture can shape the expression and outcomes of these cognitive styles, potentially affecting mental health differently across populations [\n53\n]. These cultural differences indicate that the relationship between repetitive thinking and cognitive health may vary depending on cultural context. Therefore, future research should investigate how cultural norms shape the expression and outcomes of repetitive thinking. Such studies could provide a deeper understanding of how cognitive styles influence cognitive health across different populations and contribute to developing culturally sensitive interventions that effectively reduce cognitive dysfunction.\nIn conclusion, this study provides preliminary evidence for the unique association of reflection with cognitive dysfunction in older adults, while considering the role of depressive symptoms. These findings underscore the relevance of acknowledging and managing depressive symptoms and cognitive patterns as part of a comprehensive approach to maintain brain health. Future research should continue to explore the mechanisms underlying these associations and investigate interventions that target these risk factors for the prevention and treatment of cognitive dysfunctions in older adults.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/270", "#/texts/271", "#/texts/272", "#/texts/273", "#/texts/274", "#/texts/275"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "2abc65cc-1063-4c77-9375-366300c464ce"}
