Clinically, VD is characterized by cognitive decline, memory impairment, executive dysfunction, reduced processing speed, and impaired activities of daily living, frequently accompanied by mood disturbances and personality changes (\nSmith, 2017\n). Global demographic trends indicate a rapidly aging population, driven by socioeconomic development, cultural advancements, and improved healthcare. Like AD, the prevalence of VD increases significantly with age, contributing to the growing burden of dementia worldwide. Epidemiological data reveal that VD accounts for approximately 15-20% of dementia cases in North America and Europe, while estimates in Asia and developing countries are notably higher, reaching around 30% (\nYu and Wang, 2020\n). Therefore, a deeper comprehension of VD's underlying mechanisms is essential.

Several researchers have found that patients with neurological disorders (e.g., AD) exhibit significant changes in the composition and structure of their gut flora, characterized by an increase in pathogenic bacteria and a decline in beneficial species. What's more, studies have shown that when an inflammatory response occurs in the gut environment, inflammatory factors in the brain are also elevated. Therefore, it's not difficult for us to surmise that the intestines are connected to the brain and that the intestinal flora plays a critical role in brain-to-gut communication. Both preclinical and clinical studies on VD have shown that intestinal flora is involved in mental conditions such as cognitive abilities and mood changes in the host through GBA (\nKesika et al., 2021\n). Intriguingly, with the in-depth study of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM), researchers have discovered that a variety of CHM, ranging from herbal active ingredients to herbal compounds, can mitigate damage in neurological disorders by regulating intestinal flora.

During events such as ischemia, hypoxia, or reperfusion injury, both the biological oxidative function and morphology of mitochondria become abnormal, causing a significant increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) that overwhelms the brain's antioxidant defenses. When the levels of ROS exceed a specific threshold, they can cause increased resistance to blood flow, a reduction in vasodilation and immune response, and heightened apoptosis, ultimately culminating in neuronal damage due to oxidative stress. Furthermore, ROS disrupt endothelial nitric oxide signaling, exacerbating cerebrovascular endothelial dysfunction and compromising blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity (\nCarvalho and Moreira, 2018\n). Hence, inhibiting oxidative stress response represents one of the primary methods for preventing and treating VD.\nAs a bioactive CHM compound, puerarin has been shown to improve vascular endothelial cell function and significantly mitigate oxidative stress in neurons of VD rats primarily through downregulation of pro-apoptotic Bax protein and reduction of the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio (\nQi et al., 2023\n). Additionally, Shenmayizhi decoction (SMYZD) demonstrates significant antioxidant effects in vascular cognitive impairment (VCI), evidenced by decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and increased activities of glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and superoxide dismutase (SOD)(\nSun et al., 2021\n).

These structural and functional compromises to the BBB result in increased vascular permeability, precipitating the development of vasogenic cerebral edema. Rajeev et al. observed structural alterations in the BBB within a hypoperfusion rat model, noting a significant reduction in the expression levels of tight junction proteins ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-5 (\nRajeev et al., 2022\n). This damage facilitates the entry of certain harmful substances into the brain parenchyma, potentially causing irreversible brain damage. Consequently, therapeutic strategies targeting BBB restoration may hold substantial promise in mitigating the progression of VD.\nEmerging evidence suggests that traditional herbal formulations may offer neuroprotection. By administering Sanhua Tang (SHT) via gavage, the ultrastructural damage to BBB in rats with ischemic stroke (IS) was alleviated, indicating its potential as a BBB-stabilizing agent (\nShan et al., 2024\n). Similarly, Zhang et al. reported that Pushen capsule ameliorated BBB dysfunction in IS rats, potentially via modulation of the cAMP signaling pathway (\nZhang et al., 2023\n).

Under conditions of chronic ischemia, disruption of energy synthesis and metabolic homeostasis leads to excessive release of excitatory amino acids (EAAs), accompanied by impaired reuptake mechanisms. Consequently, glutamate accumulates rapidly within the synaptic cleft (\nTraynelis et al., 2010\n). Subsequent overactivation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors by glutamate induces a massive influx of calcium ions and sustained neuronal depolarization (\nAkg\u00fcl and McBain, 2016\n). The resultant intracellular calcium overload in ischemic brain regions initiates deleterious cascades, including oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, ultimately culminating in neuronal apoptosis and necrosis. These processes not only exacerbate BBB disruption but also contribute significantly to cognitive impairment and the development of VD (\nTu and Kuo, 2015\n).\nStudies in recent years indicate that pharmacological interventions targeting excitotoxicity could provide a promising therapeutic approach for VD. Tian et al. demonstrated Shenzhi Jiannao (SZJN) prescription significantly attenuates glutamate-induced apoptosis in PC12 cells, potentially via regulation of its key targets, Caspase-3, Bax, and Bcl-2 (\nTian D. et al., 2022\n).", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/257", "#/texts/258", "#/texts/259", "#/texts/260", "#/texts/261", "#/texts/262", "#/texts/263", "#/texts/264", "#/texts/265", "#/texts/266", "#/texts/267", "#/texts/268"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "fe79153d-0851-4faf-8ce0-5acc11417074"}

Following cerebral ischemic injury, damaged neurons release excitatory neurotransmitters and ROS, which rapidly activate resident microglia and recruit peripheral immune cells. These activated immune cells subsequently secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6, amplifying the neuroinflammatory milieu. Concurrently, ischemic stress induces astrocytic swelling and rupture, further activating inflammatory pathways and promoting the release of additional mediators such as IL-8 (\nJurcau and Simion, 2021\n). The resulting inflammatory mediators and cellular exudates infiltrate the neuronal parenchyma, inducing further neuronal damage and triggering a secondary inflammatory response. This pathological cascade ultimately leads to gray matter atrophy and synaptic dysfunction, manifesting as progressive cognitive decline (\nTian Z. et al., 2022\n). Given this pathophysiology, anti-inflammatory strategies are some of the main measures to treat VD.\nLi et al. reported that intranasal administration of icariin significantly attenuates hippocampal levels of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 in a rat model of VD, concomitant with improved cognitive performance (\nLi et al., 2024\n). Additionally, baicalein has been shown to suppress microglial activation, thereby reducing hippocampal pro-inflammatory cytokine expression and ameliorating cognitive deficits (\nSong et al., 2024\n). Notably, these anti-inflammatory principles are now being translated into clinical practice. Liu and colleagues have demonstrated that Shenma Yizhi prescription, when combined with citalopram, significantly reduces serum inflammatory markers and oxidative stress, which will improve cognitive function of patients with cerebral infarction combined with cognitive dysfunction (\nLiu S. et al., 2021\n). With accumulating evidence supporting the anti-inflammatory effects of CHM in VD treatment, its application prospects in clinical treatment are expected to become more extensive.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/270", "#/texts/271", "#/texts/272", "#/texts/273", "#/texts/274", "#/texts/275", "#/texts/276", "#/texts/277", "#/texts/278", "#/texts/279", "#/texts/280", "#/texts/281"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "01e85a72-448c-4a4d-ac3d-a7b4e5a636ab"}

Studies indicate that individuals carrying the Apo E4 allele have an increased risk of developing VD (\nDavidson et al., 2006\n). Similarly, individuals with mutations in the NOTCH3 gene also exhibit a heightened risk of developing VD (\nCho et al., 2022\n). Furthermore, pathogenic mutations in this gene are associated with the development of hereditary subcortical vascular dementia (HSD), which typically presents with early onset and a higher frequency of cognitive impairment among affected individuals with a family history of the condition (\nGuo et al., 2021\n). However, there are currently very few cases of treating VD through genetic mechanisms in CHM, which is expected to become a future research direction.\nThe pathogenesis mentioned above has been summarized in\nFigure 1\n.\nFigure 1", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/283", "#/texts/284", "#/texts/285", "#/texts/286", "#/texts/287", "#/texts/288", "#/texts/289", "#/texts/290", "#/texts/291", "#/texts/292", "#/texts/293"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "f095d7ff-0be8-4159-8db2-cbea4f8a12d8"}

These symbiotic microorganisms exert a spectrum of effects on the host, which can be classified as harmful, beneficial, or neutral, and they play distinct regulatory roles in numerous physiological and pathological processes. Most of these microorganisms reside in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, where they establish dynamic ecological communities collectively termed the intestinal flora. The gut microbiota is primarily composed of three functional groups: commensal flora-typically beneficial microbes that support host health; opportunistic pathogenic flora-normally harmless but potentially pathogenic under certain conditions; and pathogenic flora-microbes associated with disease. At the phylum level, the gut microbiota is dominated by four major groups: Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria (\nSingh et al., 2022\n). As a vital part of the human body, these microorganisms are involved in the host's physiological processes, such as metabolism, nutrition, and immune response (\nJin et al., 2019\n). Furthermore, beyond their physiological roles, they also influence the host's pathological changes, including inflammatory responses and oxidative stress, establishing a mutually beneficial symbiotic relationship with the host. Ullah et al. have demonstrated that intestinal microbiota dysbiosis may contribute to pathological activation of innate immune system, subsequently inducing a cascade of pro-inflammatory responses (\nUllah et al., 2024\n).\nTable 1\nshows the predominant gut microorganisms and their functions in human physiology. Moreover, gut microbiota has already shown its significant potential in treating GI diseases (\nUllah et al., 2025\n). With the deepening of research, studies have demonstrated that there are significant alterations in the types of intestinal flora in patients with neurological disorders (\nTable 2\n), which also have been observed in patients with VD, suggesting a potential role of gut microbial imbalance in VD pathogenesis.\nTable 1\nTable 1\n.

In a case-control study, Yin et al. observed a marked disruption in the balance of intestinal flora among VD patients, featuring elevated levels of conditional pathogenic bacteria such as\nEnterobacteriaceae\n,\nBarnesiella intestinihominis\n,\nMegasphaera\n, and\nOsteobacteria\n, alongside a diminished abundance of beneficial symbiotic bacteria, including\nBacteroides\nand\nPrevotella\n(\nYin et al., 2015\n). And relevant statistical data and clinical investigations further reveal that VD patients infected with\nEnterobacteriaceae\n(e.g.,\nHelicobacter pylori\n) exhibit more severe cognitive deficits compared to their uninfected counterparts, potentially mediated by upregulated pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IL-8 (\nXu et al., 2016\n). Furthermore, Xiao et al. observed that in chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) rats with cognitive impairment, there was a decrease in the abundance of representative short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) producers, including members of the Prevotellaceae family and the Bifidobacterium genus (\nXiao W. et al., 2022\n). SCFAs, as important metabolites of gut microbiota, primarily consist of acetic, propionic, and butyric acids, which influence neuronal function by modulating calcium signaling and neurotransmitter release (\nXu et al., 2023\n). Mirzaei et al. have demonstrated that butyric acid can inhibit neuronal apoptosis and ameliorate histopathological changes in the CA1 region through the BDNF/PI3K/Akt pathway, thereby counteracting VD (\nMirzaei et al., 2021\n). Additionally, butyrate has been shown to suppress neuroinflammation, alleviate chronic alcoholic CNS impairment, and enhance cognitive and memory functions via the GPR109A/PPAR-\u03b3/TLR4-NF-\u03baB signaling pathway (\nWei et al., 2023", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/318", "#/texts/319", "#/texts/320", "#/texts/321", "#/texts/322", "#/texts/323", "#/texts/324", "#/texts/325", "#/texts/326", "#/texts/327", "#/texts/328", "#/texts/329", "#/texts/330", "#/texts/331", "#/texts/332", "#/texts/333", "#/texts/334", "#/texts/335", "#/texts/336", "#/texts/337", "#/texts/338", "#/texts/339", "#/texts/340", "#/texts/341", "#/texts/342", "#/texts/343", "#/texts/344", "#/texts/345"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "e220cc74-fdaa-4080-b8d2-83adb733155d"}

Furthermore, besides the SCFAs mentioned above, trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO)-an intestinal microbe-dependent metabolite produced from dietary choline metabolism-has been associated with vascular cognitive disorders and cerebrovascular diseases (\nTu and Xia, 2024\n). A study on intestinal microbiota transplantation has shown that elevated levels of TMAO can exacerbate the severity of stroke and cognitive deficits in a mouse model of cognitive impairment associated with stroke. Simultaneously, RNA sequencing analysis has demonstrated that TMAO accelerates the onset of VD by modifying the neuroinflammatory environment through the upregulation of a subset of genes associated with IL-17 signaling, including Lcn2, S100a8, and Ccl2 (\nKaur et al., 2023\n). Furthermore, TMAO activates the NLRP3 inflammasome, which subsequently activates pro-caspase-1, thereby inducing inflammation (\nOlejnik and Golenia, 2024\n). Consequently, reducing TMAO levels in the body may serve as an adjunctive strategy for the treatment of VD, necessitating further validation through additional animal experiments and clinical studies.\nIn summary, alterations in intestinal flora and their metabolites (such as SCFAs and TMAO) may modulate apoptotic pathways and neuroinflammatory responses in VD via related signaling pathways, including BDNF/PI3K/Akt.

This modulation occurs either through the autonomic nervous system or the endocrine system, impacting intestinal barrier integrity, GI motility, secretory processes, and the mucosal immune response (\nZhu et al., 2017\n;\nMayer et al., 2022\n). However, with the advancement of research, accumulating evidence has demonstrated that the intestinal flora not only impacts GI system but also interacts with the physiological functions of the brain. This intricate crosstalk enables gut microorganisms to modulate cerebral growth, neurodevelopment, and synaptic plasticity through three principal mechanistic pathways: vagal nerve pathways, immune regulation pathways, and neuroendocrine pathways (\nMayer et al., 2022\n). Additionally, relevant studies have indicate that gut microbiota can directly or indirectly participate in the pathogenesis and progression of various neurological disorders through its capacity to modulate neurophysiological processes in the CNS (\nCryan and O'Mahony, 2011\n;\nLuna and Foster, 2015\n;\nUllah et al., 2023\n). The primary pathway for this interaction is the GBA, which serves as a continuous, bidirectional communication channel between gut microbiota and the brain, encompassing the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, the CNS, and the ENS (\nCryan et al., 2019\n). The hypothetical bidirectional connections regulating the GBA have been illustrated in\nFigure 2\n.\nFigure 2", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/355", "#/texts/356", "#/texts/357", "#/texts/358", "#/texts/359", "#/texts/360", "#/texts/361", "#/texts/362", "#/texts/363", "#/texts/364", "#/texts/365", "#/texts/366", "#/texts/367", "#/texts/368", "#/texts/369", "#/texts/370", "#/texts/371", "#/texts/372"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "d03a2df8-266d-4d07-bfc7-86d6fac951d4"}

The GBA consists of three principal pathways: vagal nerve pathways, immune regulation pathways and neuroendocrine pathways. Microorganisms in the GI tract can establish direct neural connections with the brain by activating vagal afferents through the enteric nervous system. Additionally, gut microbial, and their synthesized metabolites and neurotransmitters regulate brain physiology by modulating immune cells to produce or release cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1. Alternatively, they may influence brain activities by stimulating enteroendocrine cells to release hormones (e.g., GABA).

This process activates the TLR4/MyD88/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway in the BBB via the GBA, resulting in neuroinflammatory responses (\nZhao et al., 2021\n) that further contribute to cognitive impairment (\nZou et al., 2023\n). Acupuncture has been shown to alleviate cognitive impairment in VD rats by inhibiting this signaling pathway, thereby reducing microglial inflammation (\nWang et al., 2020\n). Another study indicates that severe disruption of intestinal flora homeostasis can cause GBA dysfunction, leading to autonomic nervous system dysfunction and abnormal secretion of the HPA axis (\nSpaziani et al., 2008\n), significantly affecting hippocampal function (\nM\u00f6hle et al., 2016\n). For instance, in a male CCH rat model, the HPA axis is abnormally activated, resulting in sustained production of corticosterone and the development of insulin resistance, which is a significant factor accelerating the progression of dementia (\nLansdell and Dorrance, 2022\n). Additionally, serotonin (5-HT), secreted by enterochromaffin cells (ECCs), is an important neurotransmitter synthesized from tryptophan and can influence brain function via the bloodstream or the vagus nerve (\nXing et al., 2024\n). Clinical studies have reported that the expression levels of 5-HT are reduced in the brains of AD patients and in the plasma of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients (\nMattsson et al., 2022\n;\nde Natale et al., 2021\n).

Behavioral tests such as the light-dark box test and neuronal structure observation were conducted on mice that received oral administration of berberine (BBR) for 7 days after treatment for cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI). The findings indicated that BBR pretreatment ameliorated cognitive behavioral deficits in CIRI mice, alleviated neuronal structural damage, and significantly increased GSH levels. Moreover, 16S rRNA results demonstrated that BBR administration elevated levels of\nBacteroidetes\nand\nEnterobacteriaceae\nwithin the intestinal flora of mice experiencing CIRI. The aforementioned effects were attributed to BBR's reduction of oxidative stress damage by modulating the gut microbiota via the GBA (\nWang et al., 2023\n). Additionally, a randomized clinical trial has shown that BBR has achieved initial clinical translation and is now applied in the clinical treatment of cognitive deficits in patients with chronic schizophrenia (\nPu et al., 2023\n). Zhu and his colleagues administered puerarin to rats with bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO) via gavage at doses of 50, 100, or 150 mg/kg over a period of 5 weeks. The experimental effects of puerarin were investigated using methodologies such as the Morris water maze and neuropathological analyses, including HE staining and Golgi staining. The results indicated that puerarin treatment significantly improved spatial cognitive impairments in VD rats and notably increased the relative abundance of beneficial microorganisms as well as the content of SCFAs in the gut (\nZhu et al., 2021\n).

Subsequent FMT confirmed that the neuroprotective effects of curcumin were mediated by modulating gut microbiota metabolites through the GBA (\nCui et al., 2022\n). To date, the majority of clinical trial data have primarily established curcumin's therapeutic potential as an anti-inflammatory agent, showing symptomatic relief in patients with diverse inflammatory conditions (\nPanknin et al., 2023\n). There is a notable lack of clinical evidence supporting its mechanism of action through the modulation of the gut microbiota. Liu et al. developed an AD mouse model by combined administration of d-galactose and aluminum chloride. The mice were then randomized into three groups and AD mice were treated with Ginkgolide B (GB) via daily intragastric gavage for 14 consecutive days. Post-treatment, cognitive function was quantitatively assessed using behavioral tests (e.g., open field test), while intestinal flora composition was analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The results indicated that GB increased the abundance of\nBacteroides\n,\nMuribaculaceae\n, and\nAlloprevotella\nin the AD mice, regulated the imbalance of intestinal flora, and significantly alleviated cognitive dysfunction (\nLiu J. et al., 2021\n). Currently, GB injection is utilized in clinical practice, and a randomized clinical trial has demonstrated its beneficial effects in improving neurological deficits in patients with IS (\nZhao et al., 2022\n). However, its impact on gut microbiota remains unknown. In mice with CIRI, seven-day oral administration of baicalin (100 mg/kg/day) significantly altered intestinal flora composition, as demonstrated through comprehensive phenotypic evaluations (object recognition tests, morphological staining et al.) and metagenomic analyses.

Randomized controlled clinical trials have found that BYHWD can greatly improve the cognitive dysfunction of VD patients and shows less adverse reactions (\nKim et al., 2022\n). Similarly, Tang et al. utilized 16S rRNA sequencing to analyze the intestinal microbiota composition of rats with middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), following 7-day treatment with BYHWT. Neurological function was quantitatively assessed using the modified Neurological Severity Score (mNSS) test. And they discovered that BYHWT could alleviate inflammatory responses and ameliorate neuronal damage by significantly reducing the proportion of pro-inflammatory bacteria such as\nShigella\n,\nKlebsiella\n, and\nStreptococcus\nin the gut, while simultaneously increasing the abundance of beneficial bacteria like\nLactobacillus\nand\nFaecalibacterium\n(\nTang et al., 2022\n). It can be inferred that BYHWD may exert neuroprotective effects by modulating the intestinal microbiota via the GBA; however, the specific regulatory mechanisms warrant further investigation. Xixin Decoction (XXD) is effective in resolving phlegm and opening the orifices. Clinically, it is primarily utilized to enhance learning and memory abilities in patients diagnosed with AD (\nZhao et al., 2023\n).

Additionally, the diversity of the intestinal microbiota exhibited an upward trend. Western blot analysis revealed a marked increase in the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) protein in both hippocampal and colonic tissues.

In a separate study, APP/PS1 transgenic mice with dementia were orally administered Qifu Yin (QFY) for 3 months. Researchers objectively assessed the cognitive levels of these mice using the step-down test and Morris water maze test, while also analyzing intestinal flora through 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and metagenomic sequencing. The findings indicated that QFY could enhance the structure of the gut microbiota in mice, regulate the species richness of\nBacteroidetes\nand\nErysipelotrichia\n, and thereby ameliorate cognitive dysfunction (\nXiao Q. Y. et al., 2022\n). However, the current clinical focus predominantly emphasizes the cognitive improvement effects of QFY and XXD, and has yet to establish whether the observed cognitive improvements are mediated by gut microbiota modulation, as this potential mechanistic pathway remains under investigation in the existing literature. Zhang et al. administered Tong-Qiao-Huo-Xue Decoction (TQHXD) via gavage to CIRI rat models established using MCAO for 7 and 14 days, subsequently conducting high-throughput 16S rDNA sequencing. They found that the proportion of\nBacteroidetes\nin the intestines of CIRI rats increased compared to the model group, reversing the reduction of\nBifidobacterium\nand\nLactobacillus\n, thereby protecting the integrity of the intestinal epithelial mucosa (\nZhang et al., 2020\n). Meanwhile, the inflammatory response was suppressed, which is a significant factor in the development of VD.\nIn summary, it is evident that CHM can enhance cognitive functions in neurological disorder such as VD by modulating the intestinal flora. However, current research primarily focuses on isolated studies of either the brain or the gut, with limited investigations into the GBA. Consequently, there is a pressing need for more fundamental research in this area, which presents significant potential for exploration.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/457", "#/texts/458", "#/texts/459", "#/texts/460", "#/texts/461", "#/texts/462", "#/texts/463", "#/texts/464", "#/texts/465", "#/texts/466", "#/texts/467", "#/texts/468", "#/texts/469", "#/texts/470", "#/texts/471", "#/texts/472"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "f7a4a932-00dd-412b-869c-76dced8d8997"}

For example, multiple studies have shown that after microbiota transplantation, the transplanted probiotics can maintain the homeostasis of intestinal flora, reduce the occurrence of inflammatory reactions, and improve cognitive abilities. It is speculated that the intestinal flora participates in the bidirectional regulation of the GBA through immunity, endocrine or vagus nerve, and plays an important role in the cognitive activities of VD patients. The correlation and the underlying mechanisms involving intestinal flora and VD are still in the theoretical discussion stage, as they currently lack sufficient backing from both experimental and clinical research data. Therefore, it is of great research significance to use intestinal flora as a target to explore the mechanism of improving VD patients through the GBA. Further confirmation is needed to determine whether CHM can inhibit neuroinflammation, stabilize immunity and other functions by improving intestinal flora. And it is crucial to conduct in-depth research on the mechanisms of action of CHM to offer more definitive evidence for clinical management of VD.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/474"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "d47a8a52-a659-4b5c-a0ce-4a84836a5d58"}
