They are all forms of '\u03b1-synucleinopathies'-neurodegenerative diseases characterised by the abnormal deposition and accumulation of \u03b1-synuclein in the central and peripheral nervous systems [\n4\n]. The earliest features of these \u03b1-synuclein-related conditions include several non-motor symptoms pertaining to constipation, hyposmia, orthostatic hypotension, and depression [\n5\n], and these can occur many years before the overt classical motor and cognitive signs, such as slowed gait or memory impairment [\n6\n].\nOne of the earliest and most specific symptoms of prodromal \u03b1-synucleinopathy is isolated rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) [\n7\n]. This sleep disorder is characterised by muscle atonia and dream enactment behaviour during REM sleep, often involving limb movements and vocalisations, and can occur at least 10 years before a diagnosis of DLB, PD or MSA [\n7\n]. iRBD is thus a key indicator of \u03b1-synucleinopathy risk, with recent studies showing that 70-90% of people with iRBD go on to develop either DLB (50% of cases), PD (45% of cases), or MSA (5% of cases) [\n8\n].", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/69", "#/texts/70", "#/texts/71", "#/texts/72", "#/texts/73", "#/texts/74", "#/texts/75", "#/texts/76", "#/texts/77", "#/texts/78", "#/texts/79", "#/texts/80", "#/texts/81", "#/texts/82", "#/texts/83", "#/texts/84", "#/texts/85", "#/texts/86", "#/texts/87", "#/texts/88"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "dedc3a29-af06-4c15-bfd1-35f9cf5423d6"}

Precision phenotyping in iRBD using accessible home-based tests would allow for regular repeated measures and would improve our understanding of prognostication and transform clinical trial recruitment. It is recognised, for example, that when iRBD co-occurs with certain non-motor symptoms such as olfactory dysfunction, there is a substantially increased risk of progression to DLB and PD [\n10\n]. Although olfactory dysfunction can already be measured remotely with standardised tests such as the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) [\n11\n], their cost is high for regular repeated measures.

Usually, part 3 of the Movement Disorders Society revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale [\n12\n] (MDS-UPDRS-3) is used, which requires an expert rater to systematically examine for motor changes in tasks such as finger-tapping and gait. Typically, people with iRBD score in the 'normal' range [\n10\n,\n13\n], signifying that very few motor changes are detectable using this method. This contrasts with recent evidence that people with iRBD are frequently aware of subtle motor changes [\n14\n] and emphasises that further research is needed to develop new tools. Motor function measured with the Alternate Tap Test has been shown to be slower in iRBD (147.4 tap/min) than in age-matched healthy controls (191.3 tap/min) [\n15\n], but this is an in-person assessment and there is a pressing need to see how it fares when unsupervised in the community [\n16\n]. In preparation for potentially disease modifying clinical trials, and to improve access to diagnostic options in communities without easily accessible specialist services, it is imperative that changes in the severity of symptoms and signs can be measured easily and remotely in a home environment.\nIn this study, we assessed a range of remote unsupervised tests of \u03b1-synuclein-related features in a large community-dwelling cohort (\nn\n=\u20092,891) in Australia's island state of Tasmania. We aimed to evaluate if low-cost remote tests could detect differences in self-identified 'probable' RBD (pRBD) compared to controls, as a first step towards developing a suite of online/home-based tests that can be used to assess features of iRBD and \u03b1-synucleinopathies, and supplement in-person assessments.

The ISLAND Project is a public health initiative that was launched in 2019 by the Wicking Dementia Research and Education Centre at the University of Tasmania; it aims to build dementia risk management self-efficacy and decrease dementia risk in Tasmanians, and a detailed protocol has been published [\n17\n]. The ISLAND Sleep Study is a sub-study of the ISLAND project that aims to detect and characterise iRBD in this Tasmanian community sample; the protocol has been published in Bramich et al. [\n14\n]. In brief, methods of recruitment included community poster and leaflet advertisements placed in hospitals, supermarkets and community group buildings, and email invitations. Eligibility criteria for this study were being (i) a resident in Tasmania, (ii) aged 50 years or older, and (iii) a participant in the ISLAND Project. New participants for the ISLAND Sleep Study were required to sign up to the ISLAND Project if they were not already a participant, to allow for data collaboration between the two research projects and collection of detailed demographic data. Participants were excluded from the analysis if they reported a current diagnosis of DLB, PD or MSA (\nn\n=\u200918).\nThis study was approved by the University of Tasmania Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC references 26435, 29005 and 18264) and was carried out according to the National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research (2022).

ISLAND Sleep Study participants completed a battery of online health and sleep questionnaires between June and August of 2022, that were presented in a fixed order (see [\n14\n] and Table\n1\n); they could choose to complete these in one sitting or take as many breaks as they wished. Completing each part of the questionnaire was not compulsory and participants were free to move on to the next question even if there was missing data. The sleep questionnaires included the REM Sleep Behavior Disorder Single-Question Screen (RBD1Q) that asks, \"Have you ever been told, or suspected yourself, that you seem to 'act out your dreams' while asleep (for example, punching, flailing your arms in the air, making running movements, etc.)?\" [\n18\n]. It has a reported sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 75.3% for iRBD in older adult populations, when compared to the gold standard video polysomnography (vPSG) diagnostic criteria, making it one of the most reliable screening measures for RBD currently available [\n19\n]. Those that screened positive on the RBD1Q (responded 'yes') were defined as pRBD and those that screened negative as controls.\nAn adapted version of the Baylor Functional Assessment Scale (BFAS) [\n20\n] was used to investigate prodromal parkinsonism symptoms (see Fig.\n1\n). This self-report questionnaire has been validated to differentiate PD from controls [\n20\n], and was designed to assess changes in movement, from the participant's perspective. To the twelve published questions (which were scored yes\u2009=\u20091, no\u2009=\u20090; see Fig.\n1\n), one additional question was added in this study to assess for falls, which are relevant to \u03b1-synucleinopathies: \"How many falls have you had in the last year?\" (0/1/2/3/more than 3).\nFig. 1", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/127", "#/texts/128", "#/texts/129", "#/texts/130", "#/texts/131", "#/texts/132", "#/texts/133", "#/texts/134", "#/texts/135", "#/texts/136", "#/texts/137", "#/texts/138", "#/texts/139", "#/texts/140", "#/texts/141", "#/texts/142", "#/texts/143", "#/texts/144", "#/texts/145", "#/texts/146", "#/texts/147"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "ef7cd6a7-55e5-4622-a2fd-c2becb5d2212"}

It has good correlation with objective autonomic test results in people with PD, particularly for orthostatic hypotension symptoms [\n22\n]. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI [\n23\n]), was used to assess overall sleep quality, along with seven individual components of subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleep medications, and daytime dysfunction due to sleepiness.

The CANTAB assessments were administered online in October 2021 as part of the annual ISLAND project data collection [\n17\n], whilst the self-report question was administered between June and August 2022. The CANTAB has been validated in identifying early cognitive changes in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and PD [\n45\n]. The PAL task specifically assesses visual episodic memory through learning and recall of colourful abstract patterns presented within 6 possible locations on a computer screen. The number of errors made on the PAL 6 shapes trial was selected for analysis because this is highly sensitive to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) [\n46\n,\n47\n,\n48\n]. The SWM task assesses the ability to retain and manipulate visuospatial information; it involves the presentation of several coloured squares on a computer screen with the aim to locate one token in the array of squares, requiring recall from previous trials [\n49\n].

Although none are indicative of a specific \u03b1-synucleinopathy [\n10\n], there are some trends with, for example, impaired speech and tremor as typical early motor manifestations in people with PD [\n56\n], and early falls more common in those with MSA [\n57\n].

This is interesting, as the IRBDSG study found that cognition was the only variable that differed between those who developed DLB and those who developed PD, when measured by brief cognitive tests (Montreal Cognitive Assessment; MoCA) as well as neuropsychological assessments [\n10\n]. Given that CANTAB has been validated for detecting early progression of Alzheimer's disease and PD [\n45\n], it may be that the PAL and SWM tasks used in this study are not as sensitive to prodromal changes found in DLB. An alternative explanation is that subtle declines in PAL and SWM are also occurring in controls as part of cognitive age-related decline or preclinical Alzheimer's disease, causing the effect size between two groups to be less apparent [\n46\n].

This is also one of the first studies to examine autonomic dysfunction remotely in a large community cohort using the COMPASS-31, showing that signs and symptoms in those at-risk of \u03b1-synucleinopathy can be detected and monitored using this method.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/490", "#/texts/491", "#/texts/492", "#/texts/493", "#/texts/494", "#/texts/495", "#/texts/496", "#/texts/497", "#/texts/498", "#/texts/499", "#/texts/500", "#/texts/501", "#/texts/502", "#/texts/503", "#/texts/504", "#/texts/505", "#/texts/506", "#/texts/507", "#/texts/508", "#/texts/509", "#/texts/510", "#/texts/511", "#/texts/512", "#/texts/513", "#/texts/514", "#/texts/515", "#/texts/516"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "c325ac88-cd34-420d-8ae9-c90d9c8d0a81"}

Previous research has shown that people with PD report altered sensory and pain thresholds, which is thought to be caused by degeneration of pain processing neurons and pathways in the central nervous system [\n90\n,\n91\n] and there is evidence that pain begins at least a decade before a diagnosis of PD as well as throughout the clinical course of PD, DLB and MSA [\n92\n]. However, there is very little research into pain and iRBD. The first identified was a 2024 study in 159 war veterans with pRBD (and 67 polysomnography-confirmed iRBD cases), which reported significantly greater chronic pain in veterans with RBD compared to controls [\n93\n]. Here we build upon these findings in a larger sample of 235 people with pRBD, finding significantly higher reports of neuropathic and intermittent pain. This is the largest study to date assessing pain in pRBD and the results, taken together with emerging evidence in prodromal PD [\n90\n,\n94\n,\n95\n], highlight the importance of recognising pain as a key feature of \u03b1-synucleinopathies.\nIn terms of sleep, the pRBD group reported worse sleep quality, specifically increased sleep disturbance and daytime dysfunction due to sleepiness. Since iRBD involves dream enactment overnight, sleep disturbance is a common theme due to the disruption that motor events have on normal sleep patterns [\n96\n]. But other sleep disorders, such as restless leg syndrome, and the circadian rhythm changes associated with DLB, PD, or MSA could also be relevant [\n97\n].\nAs expected, levels of anxiety and depression were substantially higher in people with pRBD; this aligns with previous studies that found mood changes are common \u03b1-synuclein-related features and tend to be mild early on, but as the disease progresses, can cause an increased burden and reduced quality of life for people with DLB, PD and MSA [\n74\n,\n98\n,\n99\n,\n100\n]. It may be that targeting mood disturbance symptoms in the early period of neurodegeneration when future patients are still free of any symptoms, could have a greater impact on the trajectory of disease progression [\n101\n].", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/517", "#/texts/518", "#/texts/519", "#/texts/520", "#/texts/521", "#/texts/522", "#/texts/523", "#/texts/524", "#/texts/525", "#/texts/526", "#/texts/527", "#/texts/528", "#/texts/529", "#/texts/530", "#/texts/531", "#/texts/532", "#/texts/533", "#/texts/534", "#/texts/535", "#/texts/536", "#/texts/537", "#/texts/538", "#/texts/539", "#/texts/540", "#/texts/541", "#/texts/542", "#/texts/543", "#/texts/544", "#/texts/545", "#/texts/546", "#/texts/547"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "2f5f240a-ca6d-4d78-8350-61b19798c8a6"}

Only 1.3% of the ISLAND Sleep Study cohort identified as Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander, yet 4.3% of these participants made up the pRBD group compared to 0.9% of the control group. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to identify an association between indigenous Australian origin and iRBD, and little research on \u03b1-synucleinopathy risk has been undertaken in indigenous Australasian populations before [\n103\n]. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are known to experience more adverse health burdens than the rest of the Australian population, with epidemiological studies showing they have a greater prevalence of high blood pressure, heart disease, lung cancer, and diabetes, along with more physical disabilities, alcohol abuse and psychological distress [\n104\n,\n105\n]. Alzheimer's disease prevalence in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people is also three to five times higher than the general Australian population [\n106\n], with a possible elevation in\nAPOE\n\u03b54 allele frequency [\n107\n]. These statistics suggest that this population may be at higher risk of neurodegenerative disease more broadly, but further research is needed to explore the potential prevalence of iRBD and \u03b1-synucleinopathy risk in the Indigenous Australian population. The ISLAND Sleep Study provides a unique opportunity to do so as we have a record of strong completion rates over time (42% over 4 years) within the broader ISLAND Project [\n108\n].\nThere are several strengths and limitations to this study. The strengths are the inclusion of a large cohort of community-dwelling older adults, living across rural and urban areas with a broad spread of ages, from 50 to 90 years, and a near even sex-split in the pRBD group. We also carefully collected a wealth of additional data and variables to fully understand potential confounding effects in this cohort, and thus adjusted for the significant factors of age, sex and Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander origin.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/548", "#/texts/549", "#/texts/550", "#/texts/551", "#/texts/552", "#/texts/553", "#/texts/554", "#/texts/555", "#/texts/556", "#/texts/557", "#/texts/558", "#/texts/559", "#/texts/560", "#/texts/561", "#/texts/562", "#/texts/563", "#/texts/564", "#/texts/565"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "5554343c-5b53-45b5-b726-3580a2d9e397"}

Tasmania itself is not representative of the broader cultural diversity in Australia either, with the majority of its population coming from Northern European ancestries. Although high completion rates were obtained from this cohort, it is not yet known whether attrition will become evident over time. Usability data was not collected, therefore future projects will include questions to elucidate whether the methods used are acceptable to participants. Only one objective test of motor function was used in this project, and plans are underway to broaden future motor assessment batteries with a wider range of hand motor assessments [\n109\n], remote gait analyses [\n110\n], actigraphy monitoring, and an online test of speech function [\n111\n]. Furthermore, the reliance on a screening questionnaire for the pRBD group is also a limitation to this study with the potential for some participants to have screened false-positive on the RBD1Q, especially if they do not have a bed partner. This study is ongoing and home-based vPSGs are currently underway to confirm the presence of iRBD in this population, which will then allow for more specified analyses such as principal component analysis and machine learning to investigate patterns of features that group together within individuals, which will assist in better prediction of phenoconversion to PD, DLB or MSA.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/566", "#/texts/567", "#/texts/568", "#/texts/569", "#/texts/570", "#/texts/571", "#/texts/572"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "0abaca75-0de4-467f-b56d-3f158b19e827"}

By using this method, we have the ability to track people with pRBD over time in the community, regardless of location, mobility, funding or other factors that can impede access to in-person clinical assessments. Online self-report questionnaires and tests of motor function, combined with validated postal assessments of olfaction, can guide us towards a better understanding of the prodromal stage of \u03b1-synucleinopathy and its trajectory towards overt clinical diagnosis. With the advancement of biological determinates of PD/\u03b1-synucleinopathy [\n112\n,\n113\n,\n114\n], this assessment method would also allow for improved, long term follow up of people found to exhibit potential biomarkers, which would greatly inform the predictability of these new prodromal tests.\nTaken together, the findings of this study supplement the evidence that symptoms and signs relevant to \u03b1-synuclein-related conditions begin in the prodromal stages alongside pRBD many years before overt phenoconversion. A combined set of easily accessible, low-cost online tools and remote olfactory testing may aid researchers and clinicians in identifying people in the community who are at high risk for developing an \u03b1-synucleinopathy.
