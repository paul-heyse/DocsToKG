Cross-validation was used to assess clustering stability via the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI), Silhouette Score, and Calinski-Harabasz Index (CHI). We performed survival analyses using Kaplan-Meier curves and mixed-effects models for longitudinal cognitive data (e.g., memory, executive function, and language assessments) to examine differences in disease progression.\nResults Cross-validation analyses indicated two highly stable subtypes of cognitively impaired individuals (ARI = 0.552), exhibiting significant neuroanatomical differences. Subtype 1, termed the Temporal-Sparing Atrophy (TSA) Subtype, was defined by relatively mild atrophy, especially in temporal areas, with slower cognitive decline and preserved Function across most domains. Subtype 2, termed the Temporal-Parietal Predominated Atrophy (TPPA) Subtype, was marked by notable alterations in areas critically affected in neurodegenerative disorders. These included key areas critical for executive function and memory, such as the frontal, temporal, and parietal cortices including the precuneus. Longitudinal analysis of neuroimaging and cognitive data revealed contrasting trajectories. The TSA Subtype demonstrated a gradual decline in cognitive functions over time, particularly in the assessments that are memory-focused tests.

Importantly, clinicians encounter a spectrum of cognitive and neuroanatomical variations among patients, which are often influenced by multiple risk factors and comorbidities. This heterogeneity is critical to understand, as it impacts diagnostic accuracy, disease prognosis, and therapeutic response [3]. Characterizing disease heterogeneity within real-world clinical cohorts by identifying neurobiologically homogeneous clusters of patients can lead to more precise diagnoses and targeted treatments [4]. To this end, neuroimaging provides a reliable and reproducible noninvasive in vivo method to assess the neurobiology of brain disorders, and dementia in particular. However, the high dimensionality and complexity of neuroimaging data present significant analytical challenges.\nOver the past few decades, machine learning methods have emerged as an effective way to address these challenges because of their ability to capture complex relationships of imaging signals among brain regions [5]. This capability enhances the characterization of group differences, potentially leading to improved personalized diagnosis and prognosis, Consequently, machine learning has been increasingly successful in driving highly sensitive and specific disease biomarkers at the individual level [6]. For example, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) effectively classified patients based on neuroimaging features [7, 8], while Random Forests predicted disease progression and identified biomarkers [9, 10]. However, a common assumption behind commonly used machine learning methods is that there is a single pattern that differentiates the two contrasted groups. While this approach enables the detection of hallmark pathology, it ignores disease heterogeneity, potentially overlooking distinct neuroanatomical subtypes.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/10", "#/texts/11"], "page_nos": [1], "uuid": "58e49652-55b4-4535-88d4-935328a89388"}

Prior research studies have primarily investigated heterogeneity within well-characterized research cohorts. However, these cohorts do not represent well the variability seen in clinical practice. This limitation is particularly evident in memory clinic populations, where patients present with diverse cognitive profiles and often have uncertain diagnoses. Despite this, investigations into the neurobiological heterogeneity of dementia in clinical settings are scarce. Additionally, while longitudinal cognitive data may offer invaluable insights into disease progression, these are often overlooked in heterogeneity analyses of research or real-world clinical cohorts [22].\nIn response to these gaps in the field, we investigated the heterogeneity of neurodegeneration using data from a large publicly available sample of patients and their follow-ups seen at the Washington University Memory Diagnostic Center outpatient clinic in Saint Louis, MO by applying the HYDRA (heterogeneity through discriminative analysis) algorithm [23] to the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS-4) dataset [24], a clinically representative cohort with neuroimaging and longitudinal clinical data. Specifically, we sought to identify neuroanatomical subtypes using a semi-supervised machine learning method termed HYDRA. HYDRA is a well-established and validated method that has been successfully applied in various neurological and psychiatric disorders, consistently uncovering biologically meaningful and homogeneous clusters within heterogeneous patient populations [25-29].

Two datasets were used for patients and controls separately for this purpose.\nThe OASIS-4 dataset was employed to extract patients specifically, sourced from patients seen at the Washington University in St. Louis Memory Diagnostic Center outpatient clinic. This memory clinic cohort provides comprehensive neuroimaging and longitudinal clinical data from individuals with memory disorders and dementia. Patients at various stages of impairment underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and clinical assessments. From this dataset, we included 580 individuals aged 50 to 94 who passed FreeSurfer [30] quality checks. Longitudinal clinical assessments were available for a subset of participants. Though the number and timing of follow-up visits varied, it is a hallmark of real-world clinical data, where patients are assessed as needed rather than at fixed intervals.\nWe utilized OASIS-3 dataset [31] coming from the Washington University Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) - a research-based cohort, which is used to derive a robust reference group of cognitively unimpaired (CU) controls. We identified 536 CU individuals based on a global Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) [32] of 0 and amyloid negative. Amyloid negativity was defined as the absence of substantial preclinical cognitive impairment pathology, assessed using either cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers or amyloid positron\nemission tomography (PET) imaging. For amyloid PET, the Centiloid scale [33-35] was used to standardize quantitative amyloid measurements across different tracers and methods. A Centiloid value of \u2264 20 was used as the threshold for amyloid negativity, consistent with the widely accepted cutoff for distinguishing amyloid-negative individuals from those with amyloid-positive pathology [36]. For CSF, amyloid negativity was determined based on the A\u03b242/40 ratio that minimizes variability caused by preanalytical factors (e.g., tube adsorption) and interindividual differences in total A\u03b2 production. A threshold of A\u03b242/40\nAfter combining OASIS-3 and OASIS-4, the final dataset comprised 1,116 Subjects with 86 cortical and subcortical volumes from both the left and right hemispheres (i.e., the dimensionality of the data matrix was 1116 \u00d7 86).", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/17", "#/texts/18", "#/texts/19", "#/texts/21", "#/texts/22"], "page_nos": [1], "uuid": "73e614e6-11e0-4c35-8b9d-3da68beb4ed1"}

This polytope is formed by combining multiple linear hyperplanes, with each face defining a cluster. Whereas traditional SVMs ( a ), can only define two groups based on a single hyperplane\nHYDRA to not only differentiate healthy controls from pathological samples but also identify neuroanatomical subtypes within the pathological group by assigning cases to the different sides of the polytope. As a result, HYDRA uncovers distinct neuroimaging patterns that characterize subtypes and clusters cases by focusing on their differences from control subjects. This is contrast to unsupervised clustering techniques (e.g., k-means), which group participants based on their similarities. Lastly, HYDRA adjusts for important covariates such as age and gender, ensuring robust clustering. Note that HYDRA only uses a binary classification objective, distinguishing healthy controls from patients, to guide the discovery of multiple disease subtypes. Importantly, it does not utilize detailed diagnostic labels (e.g., mild cognitive impairment or AD) or clinical outcomes during training, allowing for the identification of data-driven neuroanatomical patterns.\nHYDRA defined neurostructural Subtypes using the z-scored regional volumetric values as input while adjusting for covariates such as age, Gender, and race.

Given the inherent randomness in anti-clustering, we repeated the matching and modeling process across 100 bootstrap iterations. For each iteration, we fit the linear mixed-effects models for six cognitive assessments and computed the difference in the median rate of change between subtypes.\nIn addition, to examine the impact of irregular followup length on longitudinal model estimates, we conducted\na secondary sensitivity analysis including only participants with at least three timepoints.

The extensive atrophy observed in the TPPA Subtype suggests greater involvement of networks critical for executive function and memory, such as the frontoparietal and default mode networks. This may explain the faster cognitive deterioration and broader functional impairments in this group. Conversely, the TSA Subtype's slower progression might be attributed to the preservation of critical neural pathways, potentially delaying the onset of severe impairments.\nIn addition to structural and cognitive differences, we observed a significant disparity in vascular burden between subtypes. The TPPA Subtype exhibited higher T1-derived WMH volumes, suggesting greater vascular risk in this group. This vascular burden may compound the effects of neurodegeneration and contribute to the accelerated clinical progression seen in the TPPA Subtype. Importantly, because our clustering was based solely on normalized gray matter measures that directly capture neurodegeneration and can be widely obtained in clinical MRI, WMH differences were not part of the model input but instead represent an additional biological dimension that may interact with atrophy patterns. It supports the idea that subtype-specific disease trajectories may arise from a combination of neurodegenerative and vascular mechanisms.

Interestingly, the Verbal Fluency Test results in the TSA Subtype, which were worse than those in the TPPA Subtype, point to a domain-specific vulnerability that stands apart from the otherwise milder pattern of global decline.

By identifying distinct subtypes based on neuroanatomical patterns, this study provides a framework for better understanding the underlying complexity of dementia, including variable clinical presentations and trajectories. The distinct rates of cognitive decline observed between subtypes reinforce the value of tailored approaches in both\n(2025) 17:215\nroutine assessments and longer-term monitoring of disease progression.\nIn parallel, our findings underscore the power of machine-learning methods, particularly semi-supervised algorithms like HYDRA, in parsing hidden heterogeneity. Unlike traditional classification models that assume a single disease pattern, HYDRA leverages multiple \"margins\" to identify unique atrophy profiles within a clinically diverse cohort. This approach is especially beneficial in real-world memory clinics, where patients may have a range of pathologies and disease trajectories beyond a single, canonical syndrome. Beyond simply detecting subtypes, machine learning (ML)-driven analyses can illuminate the specific neuroanatomical markers that differentiate these subgroups, guiding clinicians toward more nuanced and data-driven diagnostic insights. Nevertheless, the clinical utility of such clustering hinges upon robust validation, both biologically (e.g., with pathology biomarkers) and clinically (e.g., through longitudinal functional outcomes). As multimodal datasets become more common, ongoing advances in machinelearning algorithms will help integrate imaging, fluid, genetic, and functional data, further supporting more granular models of dementia progression and informing future translational research.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/148", "#/texts/150", "#/texts/151", "#/texts/152"], "page_nos": [1], "uuid": "38e16c45-3309-4e69-b033-194c791f1c04"}

First, because AD is the most common cause of dementia, having biomarker data for PET imaging, genetic markers, or fluid biomarkers would be critical for confirming or excluding AD pathology in our cohort [60]. However, the OASIS-4 dataset does not provide these biomarkers, which limits our ability to ascertain whether the identified subtypes map directly onto AD or other neurodegenerative processes. This constraint may affect the precision of our subtype classification and the overall robustness of our findings. Moreover, as our clustering approach relied on single modality design (i.e., T1-weighted structural MRI), the resulting subtypes capture dominant anatomical variation but may lack the sensitivity to differentiate Alzheimer's disease from other non-AD pathologies Such as frontotemporal lobar degeneration, vascular dementia, or mixed etiologies. Although HYDRA is designed to capture dominant neuroanatomical axes of variation, the lack of multimodal data restricts our ability to resolve overlapping atrophy patterns that may arise from distinct underlying mechanisms. Lastly, although approximately 10% of participants were African American, this remains\na single-site dataset, potentially restricting generalizability. Studies with more diverse, multi-site cohorts are needed to confirm the external validity of these findings and refine these subtypes accordingly.\n\nFuture research\nFuture studies should incorporate multimodal data, including Amyloid and Tau biomarkers, to validate the subtypes identified and better understand the biological underpinnings of the distinct trajectories observed. Investigating molecular and genetic markers that define or influence these subtypes could help elucidate individual risk profiles and heterogeneity. Additionally, longitudinal analyses combining imaging, genetic, and cognitive data may provide deeper insights into the mechanisms driving subtype-specific progression, informing future efforts toward personalized care and stratified clinical trial designs.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/154", "#/texts/156", "#/texts/158"], "page_nos": [1], "uuid": "868947b6-f41a-4af2-abe4-cf40285d9f4a"}

By applying the HYDRA algorithm to the OASIS-4 dataset, we identified two distinct subtypes of memory clinic populations based on neuroanatomical atrophy patterns and cognitive decline trajectories. These subtypes highlight the substantial variability in clinical presentations, reflecting the diversity seen in real-world clinical settings.\nThe TSA Subtype, characterized by more localized atrophy and slower cognitive decline, represents a less aggressive form of dementia, potentially offering a larger window for early intervention. In contrast, the TPPA Subtype, with widespread atrophy and faster cognitive decline, underscores the need for more intensive clinical management. These findings demonstrate the value of recognizing and analyzing heterogeneity within clinical cohorts, moving beyond traditional one-size-fits-all approaches.\nImportantly, although clear subtype differences were observed in domain-specific cognitive trajectories, these did not consistently translate into differences in global clinical progression as captured by summary metrics such as CDR or MMSE. This dissociation highlights the limitations of relying solely on global staging tools to track disease progression in memory clinic populations. Future efforts should prioritize more sensitive and domain-specific measures to better capture the true extent and variability of cognitive decline across distinct subtypes.\nThe study's emphasis on real-world clinical populations ensures that its findings are directly relevant to clinical practice and may inform more representative sampling and stratification strategies in future clinical trials. By acknowledging and addressing heterogeneity, this study contributes to the evolving landscape of neurodegenerative disorder research, offering actionable insights for future studies seeking to optimize diagnosis, monitoring, and intervention development.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/160", "#/texts/161", "#/texts/162", "#/texts/164"], "page_nos": [1], "uuid": "7c806b44-79ec-4caa-9db2-2a9f88d05ce4"}
