Using data from the Dunedin Study, we introduce an accurate and reliable measure for the rate of longitudinal aging derived from cross-sectional brain magnetic resonance imaging, that is, the Dunedin Pace of Aging Calculated from NeuroImaging (DunedinPACNI). Exporting this measure to the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, UK Biobank and BrainLat datasets revealed that faster DunedinPACNI predicted cognitive impairment, accelerated brain atrophy and conversion to diagnosed dementia. Faster DunedinPACNI also predicted physical frailty, poor health, future chronic diseases and mortality in older adults. When compared to brain age gap, DunedinPACNI was similarly or more strongly related to clinical outcomes. DunedinPACNI is a next-generation brain magnetic resonance imaging biomarker that can help researchers explore aging effects on health outcomes and evaluate the effectiveness of antiaging strategies.\n\nDunedinPACNI estimates the longitudinal Pace of Aging from a single brain image to track health and disease\nAbstract\nBrain change trajectories in healthy adults correlate with Alzheimer's related genetic variation and memory decline across life\nArticle\nOpen access\n17 December 2024\n\nDunedinPACNI estimates the longitudinal Pace of Aging from a single brain image to track health and disease\nAbstract\nDisparities in the pace of biological aging among midlife adults of the same chronological age have implications for future frailty risk and policy\nArticle\n15 March 2021\n\nDunedinPACNI estimates the longitudinal Pace of Aging from a single brain image to track health and disease\nAbstract\nBrain aging patterns in a large and diverse cohort of 49,482 individuals\nArticle\n15 August 2024", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/53", "#/texts/54", "#/texts/55", "#/texts/56", "#/texts/58", "#/texts/61", "#/texts/62", "#/texts/63", "#/texts/65", "#/texts/66", "#/texts/68", "#/texts/69"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "d812fbe4-13f5-4636-afd5-527270cd791a"}

Furthermore, aging itself is increasingly regarded as a potentially preventable cause of chronic disease.

Across two decades (ages\u2009=\u200926, 32, 38 and 45 years), we repeatedly measured 19 biomarkers of cardiovascular, metabolic, renal, immune, dental and pulmonary functioning. By averaging the decline in the trajectories of these biomarkers, we operationalized the theoretical construct of biological aging into a specific measure that we called the Pace of Aging\n2\n. We subsequently developed an epigenetic clock that accurately and reliably estimates the Pace of Aging: the Dunedin Pace of Aging Calculated from the Epigenome (DunedinPACE)\n20\n. Because DunedinPACE is calculated from a single time point measurement of DNA methylation, it has been rapidly adopted by studies on aging, where it has been associated with signs of accelerated brain aging, morbidity and mortality\n20\n,\n21\n,\n22\n,\n23\n,\n24\n,\n25\n. However, it has not been possible to export DunedinPACE or other epigenetic clocks to studies lacking DNA methylation data. This includes many neuroimaging studies of brain aging and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD).\nCurrent neuroimaging-based approaches to measure aging, akin to first-generation epigenetic clocks, involve training models to predict chronological age from variability in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of brain structure in large multiage samples\n26\n,\n27\n,\n28\n,\n29\n,\n30\n. Researchers then typically quantify a brain age gap, which reflects the difference between a participant's predicted and actual chronological age.

For both DunedinPACNI and the longitudinal Pace of Aging, higher scores indicate faster aging. Note that DunedinPACNI is a quantitative variable that indexes relative differences between people without clear units. For this reason, we restricted our interpretation to directional comparisons within studies. Associations between faster DunedinPACNI scores and measures of physical functioning, cognitive functioning and facial aging were similar to those previously observed with Pace of Aging\n2\n. In these analyses, we controlled for sex but not age because all Dunedin Study members have the same chronological age. The DunedinPACNI effect sizes for 12 of the 15 measures were within the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the original Pace of Aging (Fig.\n2b\n; full results in Supplementary Table\n1\n). This was expected given the high internal correlation between DunedinPACNI and Pace of Aging. Dunedin Study members with faster DunedinPACNI scores had worse balance, slower gait, weaker lower-body and upper-body strength, and poorer coordination; they also reported worse health and more physical limitations; performed more poorly on tests of cognitive functioning; experienced greater childhood-to-adulthood cognitive decline; and looked older.

First, the Dunedin Study, ADNI and UKB consist of data collected primarily from participants of European ancestry.

There is growing awareness that lack of representativeness in neuroimaging research may hinder clinical translation\n68\n,\n69\n, including clinical translation of brain-based predictive models\n58\n. To address this, we replicated associations with DunedinPACNI in a sample of Latin Americans, as well as low-income and non-White UKB participants. (Supplementary Tables\n15\nand\n16\n).

Third, by design, DunedinPACNI is a measure of the longitudinal rate of the aging of the body derived from a single MRI scan and is not designed to replace longitudinal measurement of brain aging through repeated MRI assessments. Fourth, DunedinPACNI is estimated through observed correlations between measures of brain structure and longitudinal aging, which could reflect multiple causal pathways. For example, faster aging of non-brain organs might cause poorer brain health or vice versa. Alternatively, both may be driven by a third factor. Fifth, although we found robust associations with aging phenotypes across both ADNI and UKB, we generally observed larger effect sizes in ADNI. This could suggest that DunedinPACNI is sensitive to dysfunction in individuals with neurodegenerative diseases.

For example, biomarkers of general aging could help identify a broad risk for many age-related diseases earlier in the lifespan, when individuals may benefit most from health and antiaging intervention\n23\n.

Lastly, biomarkers of general aging are necessary to mechanistically link exposures (for example, low socioeconomic status) to aging or to link the rate of aging to outcomes such as increased disease risk\n4\n.

First, DunedinPACNI was developed in a cohort of people all born in the same year and studied at the same ages throughout their lives, thereby avoiding biases that are introduced by differences in historical exposures across generations and across time. Second, DunedinPACNI was trained on 19 biomarkers that were each assessed over nearly two decades and thus are not influenced by short-term illnesses that can cause aberrant biomarker signals at a single assessment. Third, DunedinPACNI was derived from participants followed from birth to age 45 years-before the onset of chronic, aging-related diseases that cause divergence from typical trajectories of aging. Other biomarkers of aging are typically derived from multiage samples in which many of the older members already have chronic diseases that have altered their body and brain, so those measures may inadvertently repackage disease instead of aging. Fourth, because the Dunedin Study cohort is a population representative cohort with very low attrition and mortality rates, DunedinPACNI does not suffer from oversampling of healthy volunteers, attrition bias (that is, people with worse health being more likely to drop out) or survivor bias (that is, people with worse health dying earlier). Indeed, our results align with prior research showing that DunedinPACE, which like DunedinPACNI was trained on the longitudinal Pace of Aging, is associated with dementia, morbidity and mortality\n20\n,\n22\n,\n23\n.

The MMSE is a screening instrument that evaluates orientation, memory, attention, concentration, naming, repetition and comprehension, and ability to create a sentence and to copy two overlapping pentagons\n99\n. The MMSE is scored as the number of correctly completed items ranging from 0 (worst performance) to 30 (best performance). The MoCA is designed to detect people at the MCI stage of cognitive dysfunction\n100\n. The scale ranges from 0 (worst performance) to 30 (best performance). The RAVLT is a list learning task that assesses learning and memory. On each of five learning trials, 15 unrelated nouns are presented orally at the rate of one word per second and immediate free recall of the words is elicited. After a 30-min delay filled with unrelated testing, free recall of the original 15-word list is elicited. Both immediate recall and percentage forgotten are used. The LogMem tests I and II (delayed paragraph recall) are from the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised. Free recall of one short story is elicited immediately after being read aloud to the participant and again after a 30-min delay. The total bits of information recalled after the delay interval (maximum score\u2009=\u200925) are analyzed. The Trail Making Test, Part B, consists of 25 circles, either numbered (one through 13) or containing letters (A through L). Participants connect the circles while alternating between numbers and letters (for example, A to 1, 1 to B, B to 2, 2 to C). Time to complete (300\u2009s maximum) is the primary measure of interest. The FAQ is a self-report measure of instrumental ADLs, such as preparing meals, performing chores, keeping a schedule and traveling outside of one's neighborhood\n101\n.

All analyses in this sample controlled for age and sex.

We calculated hippocampal volume as the sum of left and right hippocampal GMV measures derived from FreeSurfer. Likewise, we calculated ventricular volume as the sum of the left and right lateral ventricular volume measures. We first repeated cross-sectional associations with cognition, frailty and poor health in UKB, substituting DunedinPACNI with hippocampal volume or ventricular volume. Next, we conducted this same procedure with our Cox proportional hazards regression models of chronic disease and mortality risk in UKB, and cognitive decline risk among CN ADNI participants.

Those who were deceased by the Phase 45 data collection had significantly lower childhood IQ's than those who were still alive (t\u2009=\u20092.09, p\u2009=\u20090.04). Center lines of boxes represent the median. Lower and upper hinges of boxes represent the 25th and 75th percentiles. Whiskers show the range. The red line connects the means of each distribution. We report childhood IQ because it is known to be a strong predictor of late-life health outcomes, as shown by many cohort studies from many nations. Childhood IQ predicts health and social outcomes in adulthood, and these outcomes include physical functions, cognitive decline, mental health, inflammation, metabolic syndrome, disease incidence, dementia, mortality, and also neuroimaging-based, genomic, and epigenetic indicators of health. Based on the literature, we report three groups: study members who died before age 45, and thus could not have taken part in data collection, study members who were alive and thus could take part, and study members who actually did take part. We compared these three groups to the original birth cohort. The figure shows that the small group of study members who had died before age 45 had significantly lower mean childhood IQ as a group. Some of the early deaths were Dunedin Study members who had more disadvantages in their lives leading to poorer health and increased risk of early mortality. Study members who died of childhood diseases may have been already unwell at the time of IQ testing, which could have lowered their scores. However, cohort members who are still alive and cohort members who took part in data collection did not differ from the full original cohort on their mean childhood IQ; they still represent population variation on this key health risk factor.
