Cheonwangbosim-dan (CWBSD) is a traditional herbal medicine widely used to improve mental and physical illness in East Asia. We aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of CWBSD in the treatment of MCI. This clinical trial adopted a double-blind, single-center, parallel-arm, prospective, randomized controlled pilot study design with a full analysis set. Forty-eight participants with MCI were randomized to the control or CWBSD groups. The participants were administered either placebo or CWBSD once daily (at a dose of 3\u2009g) for twenty-four weeks. The primary outcome measure was a change in the Korean version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale (MoCA-K). The secondary outcome measures included memory, quality of life, depression, and level of activity in daily living. Safety measures were conducted by comparing the occurrence of adverse events and changes in blood chemistry parameters, pulse rate, and blood pressure between the two groups. After 24 weeks of treatment, no significant differences in the changes in the total MoCA-K scores were detected between the two groups. Changes in secondary outcomes were not significantly different between the two groups. In the safety evaluation, there was no significant difference between the two groups with regard to the occurrence of adverse events and changes in blood chemistry parameters, blood pressure, and pulse rate. We demonstrated that CWBSD treatment may be safe and does not significantly improve cognitive function, quality of life, daily activities, or depression in individuals with MCI. Further studies are necessary to validate the efficacy and safety of CWBSD in the treatment of MCI.\nTrial registration\nClinical Research Information Service KCT0006787.\nCitation:\nKim J-H, Kim A-R, Seo B-N, Park G-C, Lee J-S (2025) Efficacy and safety of Cheonwangbosim-dan (Tian Wang Bu Xin Dan) for treatment of mild cognitive impairment: A randomized placebo-controlled pilot trial.

It is characterized by a decline in one or more cognitive domains, including memory, problem-solving, attention, concentration, language, executive functions, or visuospatial abilities, while daily activities remain largely intact [\n1\n,\n2\n]. It is a significant risk factor for dementia [\n3\n,\n4\n]. Older adults (\u2265 65 years) with MCI have an elevated risk of developing dementia within three years [\n5\n]. Many individuals with MCI may revert to normal cognition or remain stable, whereas others may exhibit progressive decline, culminating in dementia [\n6\n]. Therefore, management and early detection of MCI could aid in the prevention of dementia [\n7\n,\n8\n].\nMCI management aims to hinder, prevent, or even reverse the progression of dementia. Recommendations for management can be classified into four categories: counseling, pharmacological therapies, interventions for risk reduction, and non-pharmacological therapies [\n9\n]. No pharmacological interventions for MCI supported by high-quality evidence are currently recommended [\n10\n]. However, managing modifiable risk factors or non-pharmacological interventions, such as regular exercise and cognitive training, may be effective in managing MCI [\n7\n,\n9\n,\n11\n].", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/83", "#/texts/84", "#/texts/85", "#/texts/86", "#/texts/87", "#/texts/88", "#/texts/89", "#/texts/90", "#/texts/91", "#/texts/92", "#/texts/93", "#/texts/94", "#/texts/95", "#/texts/96", "#/texts/97", "#/texts/98", "#/texts/99", "#/texts/100", "#/texts/101", "#/texts/102", "#/texts/103", "#/texts/104", "#/texts/105", "#/texts/106", "#/texts/107", "#/texts/108", "#/texts/109", "#/texts/110"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "b92b594c-7970-45f9-8fc3-44b0792bc2db"}

First, the education on self-management and exercise provided to both groups may have influenced the results. Lifestyle modifications, including diet and physical activity, play a crucial role in managing MCI [\n40\n], and regular exercise is recommended in clinical practice guidelines to improve cognitive function in individuals with MCI [\n11\n]. However, because adherence to these lifestyle interventions was not actively monitored, it was not feasible to include them as covariates in our analysis. Future studies should systematically track diet and exercise adherence to assess their independent effects on cognitive outcomes. Second, the clinical decision-making process of traditional Chinese Medicine, including KM, may have affected the results. In KM, syndrome differentiation, also referred to as pattern identification, is the key decision-making process in clinical practice [\n41\n]. KM Clinicians diagnose patients' patterns after the professional syndrome differentiation process rather than at the disease stage and prescribe personalized herbal medicine to each patient based on KM syndrome differentiation. Previous studies have commonly reported patterns of yin deficiency, Qi deficiency, fire heat, blood stasis, and phlegm dampness among patients with cognitive impairments [\n42\n,\n43\n]. In a previous prospective observational study, approximately 80% of individuals with MCI were prescribed herbal formulae for yin (kidney) deficiency or Qi deficiency [\n44\n]. Yin (kidney) deficiency and Qi deficiency are the most common KM pattern types in patients with cognitive disorders. Thus, we adopted the CWBSD, which nourishes blood and enriches yin, as the intervention in this study. However, in older adults with MCI and phlegm dampness, blood stasis, and fire-heat KM pattern types, CWBSD may not affect cognitive function.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/314", "#/texts/315", "#/texts/316", "#/texts/317", "#/texts/318", "#/texts/319", "#/texts/320", "#/texts/321", "#/texts/322", "#/texts/323", "#/texts/324", "#/texts/325", "#/texts/326"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "69f14d19-11e8-4fb4-97f5-4b97f9dca7c3"}

First, the sample size was relatively small. Therefore, the sample size may not have been sufficient to investigate the efficacy of CWBSD in treating MCI. Therefore, the small sample size might have led to bias in the study results. Second, we did not consider syndrome differentiation based on the inclusion criteria. In a previous RCT that reported the efficacy of Qinggongshoutao for MCI, the inclusion criteria included a deficiency in kidney essence and adequate syndrome differentiation of Qinggongshoutao [\n14\n]. The inclusion criteria did not include adequate syndrome differentiation for CWBSD, which may have affected the results. Third, we investigated the short-term effects of CWBSD on MCI over a 24-week period. In previous studies, herbal medicines that exhibited significant effects on MCI in RCTs were administered for extended periods (e.g., 52 weeks [\n14\n], 2 years [\n15\n], and 24 months [\n45\n]). However, due to the short study period and limited research funding, we only investigated the short-term effects of CWBSD on MCI over a 24-week period in this study.
