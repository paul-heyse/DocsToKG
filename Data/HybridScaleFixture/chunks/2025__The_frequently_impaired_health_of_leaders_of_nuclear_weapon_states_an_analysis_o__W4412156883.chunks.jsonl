It found that eight (17%) died from chronic disease while in office, with a mean of 3.9 health conditions per person (range: 1 to 10). A majority of these eight (62%) had cardiovascular disease and other conditions included personality disorders, depression, substance use disorders, and cognitive decline from multi-infarct dementia. Of the leaders leaving office alive, 15 (38%) were considered to have had health reasons playing a potential role in this departure. This group had a mean of 2.9 health conditions per person (range: 1 to 5), and all plausibly had their performance in office impaired by their health conditions (e.g., via a severe stroke, severe depression, likely personality disorders, mood and anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders). In conclusion, these findings indicate that physical and mental health conditions among leaders of these nuclear weapon states have been common (45% [23/51] of the leaders studied). Given the importance of the decision-making around nuclear weapons by political leaders, further research on this group should be prioritized.\nPeer Review reports", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/1", "#/texts/2", "#/texts/3", "#/texts/4", "#/texts/5", "#/texts/6", "#/texts/7", "#/texts/8", "#/texts/9", "#/texts/10", "#/texts/11", "#/texts/12", "#/texts/13", "#/texts/14", "#/texts/15", "#/texts/16", "#/texts/17", "#/texts/18", "#/texts/19", "#/texts/20", "#/texts/21", "#/texts/22", "#/texts/23", "#/texts/25", "#/texts/26", "#/texts/27", "#/texts/28", "#/texts/29", "#/texts/30", "#/texts/31", "#/texts/32", "#/texts/33", "#/texts/34", "#/texts/35", "#/texts/36", "#/texts/38", "#/texts/39"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "93f4dc21-9335-4de1-8794-fa0bd9e35677"}

In 2022 Russia invaded Ukraine and the Russian leadership has made repeated implied threats around nuclear weapons [\n1\n]. The New START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) treaty looks set to expire in 2026 without replacement [\n2\n], and there is a general lack of meaningful progress with nuclear disarmament [\n3\n]. Some nuclear weapon states (NWS) are expanding their arsenals, including: China [\n4\n], Pakistan [\n5\n], North Korea [\n6\n], and the United Kingdom (UK) [\n7\n]. Furthermore, many NWS have poor track records of international relationships over time, participating in \"nuclear coercion\" on 19 occasions in the period 1946 to 2016 against another state [\n8\n].\nInformed by such issues, a major forecasting study reported a 3-11% chance of a nuclear catastrophe severe enough to kill more than 10% of humans by 2100 [\n9\n]. Nevertheless, this risk might increase further over time if developments in artificial intelligence destabilize nuclear deterrence [\n10\n].\nGood leadership and governance of NWS might be one potential mechanism to reduce such risks of nuclear war. There is evidence that leadership matters, as even when considering the constraints of domestic political institutions and the international system, \"who ends up in office plays a critical role in determining when and why countries go to war\" [\n11\n]. With some NWS, the issue of leadership might be particularly relevant, since the leader can in principle authorize the release of nuclear weapons on their own e.g., the apparent \"nuclear monarchy\" status of the US president [\n12\n]. In Russia, it appears that only two people are, in principle, needed to authorize such a launch [\n13\n].", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/41", "#/texts/42", "#/texts/43", "#/texts/44", "#/texts/45", "#/texts/46", "#/texts/47", "#/texts/48", "#/texts/49", "#/texts/50", "#/texts/51", "#/texts/52", "#/texts/53", "#/texts/54", "#/texts/55", "#/texts/56", "#/texts/57", "#/texts/58", "#/texts/59", "#/texts/60", "#/texts/61", "#/texts/62", "#/texts/63", "#/texts/64", "#/texts/65", "#/texts/66", "#/texts/67", "#/texts/68", "#/texts/69"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "a254e6ee-1b33-47d0-87f1-e47b57c080ac"}

A study considered 37 US Presidents and reported that 18 (49%) met criteria suggesting psychiatric disorder: \"depression (24%), anxiety (8%), bipolar disorder (8%), and alcohol abuse/dependence (8%) were the most common. In 10 instances (27%), a disorder was evident during presidential office, which in most cases probably impaired job performance\" [\n14\n]. This pattern of findings is supported by survey evidence for politicians in general that indicates high levels of occupation-related stressors and adverse impacts on mental well-being [\n15\n,\n16\n,\n17\n,\n18\n,\n19\n] (including a 2024 review of 18 publications [\n20\n]). In particular, a study of Members of Parliament in the UK found that they had higher rates of \"common mental health problems\" at a prevalence of 34%, (95% CI: 27-42%) versus 17% (95% CI: 13-21%) in the high-income comparison group [\n19\n].\nOther work has taken a case study approach to the physical and mental health of incumbent leaders and the way that these conditions may have impacted on their performance [\n21\n,\n22\n,\n23\n,\n24\n], (see Supporting Information). A stand out example was the likely poor mental health of Khrushchev (Soviet Union) whose actions precipitated the Cuban Missile Crisis [\n25\n], and provoked the Berlin Crisis [\n26\n], both of which risked triggering a nuclear war. Another was the likely poor mental health of President Richard Nixon (US), who at various times was too intoxicated with alcohol to participate in key decision-making (e.g., during a Middle East crisis where others made a decision to raise the alert status of the US nuclear forces [\n27\n]).\nOverall, however, a recent study concluded that \"the intersection between psychiatry and democratic governance, specifically regarding mental health-related limitations in political leaders, remains largely underexamined\" [\n28\n].

In three cases the leader was forced out of office, in another three they chose not to re-stand for office, and in nine cases they resigned.

But when considering these and the chronic disease deaths in office, there was a slight downward trend in the proportion of health-related reasons for leaving office (Fig.\n1\n). Such a decline may largely reflect background trends in population-wide improvements in health status as seen for a wider group of leaders in terms of declining cardiovascular disease mortality [\n29\n].\nDespite such a slight downward trend in health reasons for leaving office, the nature of the health issues we identified is still concerning. Indeed, all the 15 leaders listed in Table\n3\ncould plausibly have had their performance in office impaired by their respective health conditions. The degree of impairment might have ranged from relatively mild (for the two with possible anxiety disorders) up to profound, as in the case of Ariel Sharon (a stroke causing a coma) and Menachem Begin (whose depression was so severe he spent his last year as leader isolated in his home; see Supporting Information Table\nS2\n).

This may have particularly been a problem for the autocracies where health information on the leadership has typically been more closely guarded (e.g., China and North Korea). But more generally there was typically far more detail in the often multiple English-language biographies of leaders of the US, UK, Soviet Union/Russia and Israel, than for leaders of China, India, Pakistan, and North Korea.

In the 11 months after his September 1955 heart attack, it was reported that he was \"incapacitated for six of them\" [\n36\n].\n- John F. Kennedy (US) - who had poor health in his first two years in office (i.e., from Addison's disease [see above], back pain, and misuse of anabolic steroids and amphetamines) [\n21\n,\n23\n]. This period covered his authorization of the Bay of Pigs fiasco and his poor performance at a Vienna Summit with Soviet leader Khrushchev [\n21\n].\n- Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand (France) - despite finishing when at the conclusion of his term limit, he had unofficially been impaired by cancer for some time and died just months after leaving office (Table\n1\n). E.g., his personal doctor in late 1994 stated that he \"had concluded that the President was no longer capable of carrying out his duties\" [\n21\n].\n- Ronald Reagan (US) - despite finishing when his term limit ended, he may have been impaired in the last part of his presidency with early dementia [\n37\n,\n38\n,\n39\n]. (The under-appreciated severity of his gunshot injuries is also relevant - as mentioned above.)\n- Atal Bihari Vajpayee (India) - despite finishing when he lost an election, he had a range of health conditions during his leadership. These including apparent memory loss, periods of confusion and periods of \"indecipherable ramblings\" [\n40\n]. His poor health meant he came to \"heavily depend on a handful of people, physically and otherwise. And that led to things going out of control...\" [\n41\n].", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/220", "#/texts/221", "#/texts/222", "#/texts/223", "#/texts/224"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "89ab2422-d60e-477f-9974-5fcb703d364a"}

The research agenda should also be expanded to include former leaders of NWS who are still alive (\nn\n=\u200929 as of 1 January 2024) and the nine incumbent leaders. While there are difficulties with such data on living people (given the privacy and secrecy issues), further research could clarify what aspects of this information is in the public interest and the appropriate ethical safeguards required.\nIn terms of other research techniques, lexical analysis of the word use of leaders over time is one promising method in detecting early dementia, as per the published research on Reagan [\n37\n], and Harold Wilson [\n42\n]. Another approach to understanding a leader applied an \"operational code scheme\" to a corpus of over one million words spoken by President Vladimir Putin across his time in office [\n43\n]. Studying the public utterances and behavior patterns of politicians can also be used to potentially inform leader health and personality issues (e.g., as used in the US context [\n44\n,\n45\n,\n46\n]). Artificial intelligence (AI) tools could potentially facilitate such analyses and consider a wide range of data sources including the \"leader's published writings, interviews, social media activity, speeches, videos, media appears and interviews with the leader's intimates, contacts, colleagues...\" [\n47\n].\nStudying any associations between leader health and nuclear weapon related decision-making is important but difficult, given the complexities around the role of the leader and defining nuclear weapon-related crises e.g., the six \"borderline\" cases in a list of 19 documented nuclear crises [\n8\n]. Potential other data sources relating to leader decision-making could include data around diplomatic initiatives (both peaceful and aggressive), non-nuclear crises, and changes in militarism metrics [\n48\n]. Declassified meeting minutes and personal notes, along with interviews of key informants who worked with the leader could all be used to study decision-making.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/226", "#/texts/227", "#/texts/228", "#/texts/229", "#/texts/230", "#/texts/231", "#/texts/232", "#/texts/233", "#/texts/234", "#/texts/235", "#/texts/236", "#/texts/237", "#/texts/238", "#/texts/239", "#/texts/240", "#/texts/241", "#/texts/242", "#/texts/243", "#/texts/244", "#/texts/245", "#/texts/246", "#/texts/247", "#/texts/248"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "23252c6b-099c-4424-8b4b-eb4263cc1bf2"}

Concerning the actual leaders, potential options for the less autocratic and more open states are to have term limits for the leader (which are not currently used in all NWS), and to have recall systems (where voters can petition for a politician to be recalled). A more rigorous measure might be to require medical and psychological assessments by a politically independent expert panel both before and during office [\n21\n,\n49\n] (although some argue against this approach [\n50\n]). Maintaining a strong media with investigative journalists can also help expose impairment in leaders and expose attempts by their enablers to hide any such impairments. Determining the optimal mix of such approaches to dealing with impaired leaders will require an interdisciplinary approach. As Smith et al. argue, it \"may involve additional exchanges between policymakers, alongside interdisciplinary dialogues between psychiatrists, psychologists, legal scholars, and political actors\" [\n28\n]. Finally, at the individual political leader level, there are a range of proposals for how improved system design could reduce stress on politicians and better address their mental health needs [\n15\n,\n18\n].\n\nThe frequently impaired health of leaders of nuclear weapon states: an analysis of 51 deceased leaders\nData availability\nAll data generated or analyzed during this study are included in this published article and its supporting information files.\n\nThe frequently impaired health of leaders of nuclear weapon states: an analysis of 51 deceased leaders\nChange history\n- 02 August 2025 The original online version of this article was revised: The hyperlinks for the two supplementary files' link were inadvertently interchanged.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/249", "#/texts/250", "#/texts/251", "#/texts/252", "#/texts/253", "#/texts/254", "#/texts/255", "#/texts/256", "#/texts/257", "#/texts/258", "#/texts/259", "#/texts/260", "#/texts/261", "#/texts/263", "#/texts/265"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "0ae849f9-1ef5-4e5a-8e24-749282d7591c"}
