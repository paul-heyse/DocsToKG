Using data from the Korea Dementia Research Center's Trial Ready Registry, we examined the associations between a history of GA after the age of 50 and cognitive function, as measured using the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) and Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) scores, across the normal, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia groups. Ordinal logistic regression and subgroup analyses were performed on 688 participants (258 cognitively normal, 245 with MCI, and 185 with dementia). In the normal group, a history of GA was associated with higher CDR-SB (odds ratio [OR] = 2.20, P = 0.031) and GDS scores (OR = 1.87, P = 0.053). However, in the dementia group, GA was associated with lower CDR-SB (OR = 0.43, P = 0.032) and GDS scores (OR = 0.40, P = 0.022). Participants with a history of GA had higher CDR-SB and GDS scores in the normal group, but lower scores in the dementia group. No significant associations were observed in the MCI group. Thus, the relationship between GA exposure and cognitive function may differ depending on the stage of cognitive impairment, highlighting the need for stage-specific approaches in future research.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/pictures/0", "#/texts/0", "#/texts/1", "#/texts/2", "#/texts/4", "#/texts/6", "#/texts/8", "#/texts/9", "#/texts/10", "#/texts/11", "#/texts/12", "#/texts/13", "#/texts/16"], "page_nos": [1], "uuid": "99b93436-5b90-454c-b7ae-547acbe1c0e5"}

Its global prevalence is rising rapidly, with an estimated 55 million people being affected in 2020, and is projected to increase to 78 million by 2030 and 139 million by 2050$^{2}$. This dramatic increase presents a notable challenge to healthcare systems and societies worldwide.\nThe clinical evaluation of dementia typically involves the use of standardized cognitive assessment tools, such as the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMS), Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), and Global Deterioration Scale (GDS). These instruments assess the cognitive, functional, and behavioral aspects of dementia severity across various stages of cognitive decline$^{3-5}$ and are essential for early disease detection, monitoring of disease progression, and evaluation of the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions$^{6,7}$.\nNumerous risk factors have been implicated in the development and progression of dementia. Aging remains the most critical determinant, with the prevalence doubling approximately every five years after the age of 65$^{8}$. Other factors include genetic predisposition (e.g., E4 variant of apolipoprotein E [APOE4]), cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, obesity, smoking, and low educational attainment$^{9-11}$. However, the roles of certain potential risk factors remain controversial. For instance, previous studies have reported conflicting findings regarding the association between hypertension and dementia$^{12}$ and that between general anesthesia (GA) exposure and subsequent cognitive decline or dementia. Although some studies have suggested a positive association$^{13,14}$, others have reported no significant relationship$^{15,16}$.\nIn the present study, we aimed to examine the factors associated with cognitive impairment, as assessed by the CDR and GDS scores, across distinct cognitive diagnostic groups.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/18", "#/texts/19", "#/texts/20", "#/texts/22"], "page_nos": [1], "uuid": "506f989c-7b19-4f36-9ca2-507135b6f31c"}

Among the participants, 258 (37.5%), 245 (35.6%), and 185 (26.9%) were classified as normal subjects, participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and participants with dementia, respectively. The median number of years of education was 12 across all groups; however, the distribution differed significantly among the groups ( P = 0.013). There was no significant difference in the prevalence of a family history of dementia. A total of 186 participants (26.6%) had a history of GA after 50 years of age, 135 (19.6%) had diabetes mellitus, 313 (45.5%) had hypertension, 294 (42.7%) had dyslipidemia, 72 (10.5%) had a history of malignancy, and 258 (37.5%) were APOE4 carriers.

Contrary to the assumption that GA exacerbates cognitive decline, our findings reveal a stage-specific pattern. In cognitively normal individuals, a history of GA was associated with higher CDR-SB and GDS scores. In contrast, no significant relationship was observed in the MCI group, and intriguingly, a history of GA was associated with lower CDR-SB and GDS scores in individuals with dementia.\nThe observed association between GA and higher cognitive burden (as measured by the CDR-SB and GDS) in the normal group is consistent with previous studies reporting that GA exposure may accelerate subtle cognitive changes or unmask the underlying neuropathological processes$^{17,18}$. Such processes can involve inflammation, disruption of the blood-brain barrier, or exacerbation of preclinical neurodegenerative changes$^{17}$. These effects may vary depending on the type of anesthetic agent used; a recent study has indicated that the use of desflurane and midazolam may be linked to a higher risk of dementia, whereas profofol appears to have no significant association$^{19}$.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/46", "#/texts/48", "#/texts/50", "#/texts/51"], "page_nos": [1], "uuid": "524b95c3-591d-4070-99dd-19ff0c182d87"}

First, certain anesthetic regimens or perioperative management strategies may help preserve or stabilize cognitive function in patients with advanced neurodegenerative diseases. Some studies have suggested that anesthetic protocols may attenuate the postoperative systemic inflammatory response$^{20}$ and that perioperative administration of agents such as dexmedetomidine may notably suppress the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1$^{21}$. However, in our study, we did not collect information regarding the specific indications for GA or the types of surgical procedures performed; this limited our ability to assess the potential role of cancer- or other disease-specific factors in these associations. Second, the inverse association may reflect improvements in cognition following the surgical treatment of an underlying condition. For example, cognitive improvement after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery may occur because of improved general health, enhanced quality of life, and a reduction in the number of previously prescribed medications. In such cases, surgical intervention may alleviate the underlying pathology that caused the cognitive impairment; the resulting improvement in the quality of life may contribute to the improvement of cognitive outcomes$^{22}$. Therefore, this hypothesis may not reflect the effects of GA itself, but rather, the impact of treating the primary pathology through surgery.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/52"], "page_nos": [1], "uuid": "94cf626a-0c10-40b5-9711-14e6bc44881b"}

Individuals with dementia who undergo GA may systematically differ from those who do not, possibly having fewer comorbidities, better general health, or greater healthcare access. While our findings raise intriguing possibilities, the above interpretations remain speculative and warrant further investigation through prospective studies with detailed anesthetic and surgical data. Therefore, future studies should assess potential modifiers, such as GA type (e.g., inhalational vs. intravenous), the type and duration of surgery, and perioperative complications to better characterize these divergent outcomes. Additionally, prospective studies incorporating not only neuroimaging modalities (e.g., amyloid or tau PET) but also blood-based biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease, inflammatory biomarkers, and more comprehensive medical records, could also help elucidate the mechanisms whereby GA exerts variable effects on cognitive function 23,24 .\nThis study has a few limitations. First, the retrospective design of our study and reliance on an anonymized database limited our ability to establish definitive causal relationships. Second, detailed information on the type of GA, its duration, and intraoperative management was not available; all these parameters may have independently influenced the cognitive outcomes. Third, the temporal relationship between GA exposure and assessment of cognitive function (CDR and GDS scores) was not clearly defined. Because the dataset merely indicated whether the participants had undergone GA after the age of 50, we were unable to evaluate the potential risk of cognitive impairment in relation to the specific timing of GA. Despite these limitations, the relatively large sample size enabled us to identify statistically significant associations between GA exposure and cognitive measures across the diagnostic groups. Unlike previous studies, our analysis stratified participants according to their cognitive status and incorporated a wide range of relevant covariates, including educational level, family history of dementia, APOE4 carrier status, and amyloid PET findings; this enhanced the robustness and clinical relevance of our findings.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/54", "#/texts/55"], "page_nos": [1], "uuid": "0c646945-6aca-40e0-a150-e8e953f86ac6"}

While GA may contribute to a higher cognitive burden among individuals who are cognitively normal, it appears to have an inverse relationship with the CDR-SB and GDS scores in those with established dementia.
