The United States dominated the field, while research output from countries like China grew rapidly. Research hotspots evolved from early explorations of molecular mechanisms toward clinical and translational studies focusing on neuroimaging, biomarkers, application of MDS diagnostic criteria, non-motor symptoms, and cognitive subtypes. Recently, machine learning, multi-omics integration, neuroinflammation, and mitochondrial function have emerged as new frontiers.\nConclusion:\nMild cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease research has progressed from basic mechanism exploration to a multidisciplinary, integrated clinical-basic stage, following an evolutionary path of \"pathological mechanism - clinical phenotype - biomarker - intervention strategy.\" Future research should focus on unifying diagnostic criteria, deepening understanding of multifactorial pathological mechanisms, developing precise biomarker combinations, and exploring individualized intervention strategies to achieve early warning and disease modification for PD-MCI.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/169", "#/texts/170", "#/texts/171", "#/texts/172", "#/texts/173", "#/texts/174", "#/texts/175", "#/texts/176", "#/texts/177", "#/texts/178", "#/texts/179", "#/texts/180", "#/texts/181", "#/texts/182", "#/texts/183", "#/texts/184", "#/texts/185", "#/texts/186", "#/texts/187", "#/texts/188"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "d3355abd-9542-43de-98b1-b50669621f90"}

In recent years, Mild Cognitive Impairment in Parkinson's Disease (PD-MCI), representing a transitional state between normal cognition and dementia, has garnered considerable academic attention. Epidemiological data indicate that approximately 20%-50% of individuals with PD manifest PD-MCI in the early stages of the disease (\nChaudhary et al., 2020\n;\nGuo et al., 2021\n), with up to 30% of cases presenting with significant cognitive impairment at the time of diagnosis. This suggests that PD-MCI is not only an independent predictor of dementia development but also serves as a critical marker for the therapeutic window (\nGuo et al., 2019\n). Currently, the most widely accepted diagnostic criteria for PD-MCI are those established by the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society (MDS) Task Force in 2012 (\nLitvan et al., 2012\n), which require a diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD), a gradual cognitive decline reported by the patient/informant or observed by the clinician, cognitive impairment on standardized neuropsychological testing involving at least two tests with performance, for example, \u22651.5 SD below normative data, and cognitive deficits that do not interfere significantly with functional independence.

Neuropathological studies implicate synergistic interactions between a-synuclein pathology and contributions from several other neurotransmitter systems, including dopamine and perhaps especially cholinergic dysfunction in PD-MCI pathogenesis (\nZhang et al., 2018\n;\nvan der Zee et al., 2022\n;\nReal et al., 2023\n;\nLi et al., 2024\n;\nYoo et al., 2024\n).

While both represent transitional states to dementia, key differences exist. In contrast to aMCI, which primarily features prominent memory deficits reflecting medial temporal lobe and hippocampal pathology associated with amyloid-\u03b2 and tau, PD-MCI typically exhibits a more heterogeneous cognitive profile (\nArruda et al., 2023\n;\nMaggi et al., 2024\n). Deficits in executive function, attention, and visuospatial abilities may be more prominent than memory impairment in early PD-MCI; deficits may fronto-striatal circuit dysfunction, dopaminergic degeneration, \u03b1-synuclein pathology in multiple networks, as well as contributions from co-pathologies (\nXu et al., 2021\n;\nYang et al., 2023\n;\nHjelle et al., 2025\n). There are guidelines and suggestions for neuro-psychological testing that is relevant for PD-MCI [e.g., (\nBezdicek et al., 2025\n;\nBiundo et al., 2025\n)].

Secondly, longitudinal data indicate that predictive models for the conversion of PD-MCI to dementia lack systematic integration of gene-environment interactions (\nPuig-Davi et al., 2024\n). Thirdly, although pharmacological interventions, such as cholinesterase inhibitors, have demonstrated partial efficacy in randomized controlled trials, their precise mechanisms of action on specific cognitive domains and their long-term safety profiles require further rigorous validation (\nMamikonyan et al., 2015\n;\nLoprinzi et al., 2018\n). In this context, conducting a global bibliometric study can provide a panoramic overview of knowledge evolution, identify interdisciplinary collaboration networks, and reveal regional research characteristics and disparities in resource allocation, thereby furnishing a scientific basis for optimizing research paradigms and formulating individualized diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines. Therefore, the primary objectives of this bibliometric analysis were to characterize the global research landscape of PD-MCI over the past two decades, encompassing publication/citation trends, country/institutional contributions, collaborative networks, core journals, and knowledge structures; to identify evolving research hotspots and emerging frontiers through keyword and reference analysis; and to highlight current knowledge gaps and suggest potential future research directions based on the synthesized findings.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/237", "#/texts/238", "#/texts/239", "#/texts/240", "#/texts/241", "#/texts/242", "#/texts/243"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "b997c055-2f46-4097-8d42-1789cb732d4e"}

WoSCC is globally recognized as an authoritative citation database and is the predominant source used in bibliometric studies due to its comprehensive coverage of high-impact journals in the sciences, its robust citation indexing enabling network analysis, and the standardized metadata format essential for tools like CiteSpace and VOSviewer. While databases like SSCI, PsycINFO, and CINAHL cover valuable social science, psychology, and nursing/allied health literature, our primary focus was on capturing the core biomedical and clinical research output on PD-MCI, which is predominantly indexed in SCIE. Furthermore, using a single, well-structured database like WoSCC ensures data consistency and compatibility across the bibliometric software tools employed, which is critical for reproducibility. Expanding the search to multiple databases with differing indexing standards and export formats would introduce significant challenges in data deduplication, harmonization, and analysis workflow integration, potentially compromising the reliability and comparability of the bibliometric network analyses. This study collected literature pertaining to Mild Cognitive Impairment in Parkinson's Disease published between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2024. The retrieved dataset encompassed comprehensive citation metadata essential for knowledge graph analysis, including article titles, abstracts, keywords, author affiliations, institutional/country distributions, citation frequencies, and collaboration networks.

This surge indicates a dramatic expansion in the visibility, recognition, and academic impact of research in this field.\nFIGURE 2\nFigure 2.\nTrends in annual publications and cited articles on PD-MCI between 2005 and 2024.\nA strong positive correlation exists between publication volume and citation counts. Notably, particularly during the latter half of the study period, the growth rate of citations significantly outpaced that of publications. Even after publication volume peaked in 2021, annual citations continued to demonstrate substantial growth, suggesting that published research, especially recent literature, is progressively accumulating considerable academic influence and stimulating further investigation. Overall, research on PD-MCI has evolved from a relatively nascent field in the early 21st century into a highly active and influential research direction. The rapid proliferation of publications, and particularly the dramatic increase in citations, collectively underscore the escalating importance of PD-MCI in both clinical practice and scientific investigation.

The United States (USA) demonstrated absolute leadership in this field, with its publication output (922 articles), total citation frequency (64,138 citations), and network centrality (0.32) being significantly preeminent. This indicates not only a substantial scale of research production and high impact but also a pivotal role as a central hub within the international collaboration network. Italy ranked second with 406 publications and, by virtue of its high total citation frequency (21,876 citations) and centrality second only to the USA (0.17), emerged as a significant research contributor and collaborative node. Although China ranked third with 404 publications, showcasing robust research productivity, its average citations per publication (39.82) and network centrality (0.05) were relatively lower, which may reflect factors such as the more recent rapid expansion of PD research output in China, potential differences in publication language focus, or variations in research collaboration patterns compared to established networks in the US and Europe. Notably, several countries, while not having the highest total publication volume, exhibited substantial research impact. Australia (average citations: 90.13), the Netherlands (88.48), Germany (84.49), and the United Kingdom (81.49) ranked among the highest in terms of average citations per publication, reflecting the high quality and impact of their research outputs. Among these, Australia (0.13) and the Netherlands (0.11) also demonstrated considerable network centrality. In contrast, South Korea, despite being among the top 10 producing countries, ranked relatively lower across various citation metrics and centrality (0.01). In summary, the global landscape of PD-MCI research is characterized by US leadership, with significant contributions from multiple European nations and Australia due to their high-quality research. China, as a high-output country, possesses considerable potential for enhancing its research impact and deepening international collaborations.

It proposes a two-level assessment system based on clinical observation and neuropsychological testing, requiring abnormalities in at least two cognitive domain tests to define single/multi-domain subtypes, while excluding cognitive impairment attributable to other etiologies. The guidelines emphasize that cognitive function should not significantly impair daily independence. These criteria aim to unify the identification framework for PD-MCI, support early screening of patients at high risk for dementia, facilitate clinical interventions, and provide a foundation for research into cognitive decline mechanisms and biomarker validation.

Between 2005 and 2015, research focused on molecular pathological mechanisms such as \u03b1-synuclein and the dopaminergic system, with studies investigating the association between oxidative stress and neurodegeneration being predominant. After 2015, neuroimaging techniques, biomarker validation, and the classification of PD-MCI subtypes emerged as core growth poles, reflecting a systematic paradigm shift in research from foundational mechanisms toward multimodal diagnostic technologies. The diagonal distribution within the heatmap reveals temporal evolutionary patterns: early high-frequency terms were gradually replaced by PD-MCI-specific indicators. Furthermore, post-2018, neuropsychological assessment tools and quantitative magnetic resonance parameters formed co-occurrence clusters, suggesting the maturation of a clinical-imaging joint diagnostic framework. This evolutionary trajectory highlights that PD-MCI research has entered a phase focused on constructing pathological-clinical correlation models.

Investigations into abnormal neural network connectivity have revealed that reduced functional connectivity within the Default Mode Network (DMN) and fronto-striatal circuits (\nDelgado-Alvarado et al., 2023\n;\nPan et al., 2024\n), along with white matter microstructural damage (\nZhang et al., 2023\n;\nGao et al., 2024\n), have emerged as core imaging features of PD-MCI, often preceding the onset of clinical symptoms. The interplay between neuroinflammation and metabolic dysregulation (\nLado et al., 2024\n) offers a novel mechanistic perspective on cognitive decline. In the diagnostic realm, multimodal frameworks integrating structural MRI, functional imaging, and fluid biomarkers have significantly enhanced the precision of subtype classification. Furthermore, the fusion analysis of clinical, imaging, and genetic data using machine learning algorithms (\nDadar et al., 2022\n;\nPourzinal et al., 2022\n;\nYang et al., 2023\n) has driven the identification of heterogeneous subtypes, such as \"attentional\" and \"executive\" subtypes, thereby laying the groundwork for personalized interventions (\nWang et al., 2022\n;\nGaron et al., 2024\n).", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/372", "#/texts/373", "#/texts/374", "#/texts/375", "#/texts/376", "#/texts/377", "#/texts/378", "#/texts/379", "#/texts/380", "#/texts/381", "#/texts/382", "#/texts/383", "#/texts/384", "#/texts/385", "#/texts/386", "#/texts/387", "#/texts/388", "#/texts/389", "#/texts/390", "#/texts/391", "#/texts/392", "#/texts/393", "#/texts/394", "#/texts/395", "#/texts/396", "#/texts/397", "#/texts/398"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "49986eb9-e193-40ac-b208-8f6f5add04bc"}

Recent evidence highlights the strong association between specific NMS, such as REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), and PD-MCI development, suggesting shared underlying neural substrates or prodromal states (\nChiang et al., 2024\n). Furthermore, individuals with PD-MCI experience multifaceted functional impairments linked to NMS burden, impacting daily living and quality of life (\nChen et al., 2022\n). Importantly, genetic factors, particularly GBA variants, have been shown to not only elevate PD-MCI risk but also modulate the effects of cognitive reserve (\nChang et al., 2024\n;\nYuan et al., 2025\n). This underscores the critical need for precision stratification approaches in both research and clinical management of PD-MCI. The foundational diagnostic criteria established by\nLitvan et al. (2012)\nand their subsequent international validation by the MDS study group (\nGeurtsen et al., 2014\n) remain paramount.

The MDS diagnostic criteria (\nLitvan et al., 2012\n) emerged as the most co-cited reference, confirming its pivotal role in standardizing PD-MCI identification. However, our analysis also reveals persistent limitations: variations in cognitive domain cut-off thresholds (\nLiepelt-Scarfone et al., 2021\n) and culturally unvalidated assessment tools (\nWang et al., 2025\n) continue to compromise inter-study comparability. Biomarkers like serum cystatin C show promise (\nYang et al., 2021\n;\nWang et al., 2025\n) but require large cohort validation for sensitivity/specificity. Critically, the co-occurrence of multiple pathologies (\nGonzalez-Latapi et al., 2021\n;\nCarceles-Cordon et al., 2023\n) revealed in keyword clusters drives heterogeneity in brain structural damage patterns (\nCicero et al., 2022\n), evidenced by DKI-detected white matter microstructural differences between PD-MCI and PDD. This complexity necessitates unified subtype criteria integrating imaging, fluid biomarkers, and non-motor symptom profiles.\nOur results highlight significant gaps in addressing the second challenge: developing predictive models that systematically integrate gene-environment interactions. While longitudinal studies exist (\nFilippi et al., 2020\n;\nPuig-Davi et al., 2024\n), current models fail to incorporate genetic modifiers and their interaction with cognitive reserve (\nChang et al., 2024\n). This is critical as genetic factors accelerate decline trajectories - our keyword bursts revealed \"genetic risk\" as an emerging frontier. Machine learning applications remain limited by insufficient multimodal data fusion.

Cholinesterase inhibitors provide only symptomatic relief with domain-specific response uncertainties (\nSun and Armstrong, 2021\n). Clinical trial designs often overlook subtype heterogeneity (\nBayram et al., 2023\n), while animal models poorly replicate human cognitive diversity (\nZhang et al., 2021\n). Translational bottlenecks are compounded by inadequate algorithms for multimodal data fusion. These limitations are reflected in our results through minimal burst activity in therapeutic keywords.\nConverging solutions for these challenges lie in precision medicine frameworks that encompass stratified diagnosis by combining fluid biomarkers with multimodal neuroimaging and AI to detect co-pathologies (\nGaron et al., 2021\n), subtype-specific management through defining executive/memory/mixed subtypes via neuropsychology, genetic profiling (\nThaler et al., 2024\n), and dynamic monitoring, and targeted interventions by developing mitochondrial/neuroinflammation therapies (\nYou et al., 2024\n), optimizing neuromodulation (\nHan et al., 2021\n), and implementing A\u03b2-stratified drug protocols (\nBayram et al., 2023\n).

First, the analysis was restricted to data from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) to ensure software compatibility, potentially excluding relevant studies indexed in other databases such as PubMed, Google Scholar, and Embase. Second, emerging high-quality publications may not have received sufficient representation due to lower citation frequencies characteristic of recently published works. Finally, the exclusive inclusion of English-language literature may introduce selection bias, particularly regarding region-specific research contributions. These constraints should inform cautious interpretation of the findings while highlighting opportunities for methodological refinement in future bibliometric investigations.\n\nMapping the research landscape of Mild Cognitive Impairment in Parkinson's disease: a bibliometric and visualization analysis\nConclusion\nThis study reveals that research on PD-MCI has undergone a three-stage paradigm shift, progressing from the exploration of molecular mechanisms and validation of imaging biomarkers to multi-omics integration. Driven by international collaboration, the United States and Europe have spearheaded core breakthroughs, whereas emerging research systems such as China show potential to enhance impact through cross-regional collaboration and translational research. Current challenges primarily involve the heterogeneity of diagnostic criteria, the incompletely understood co-pathological mechanisms of \u03b1-synuclein/A\u03b2, and the scarcity of disease-modifying therapies. Future efforts should focus on multimodal biomarkers, the development of gene-environment interaction models, and precise interventions targeting the mitochondria-neuroinflammation axis.
