Currently, the diagnosis of PSCI in the clinic mostly relies on subjective scale assessment, the untimeliness and imprecision of results greatly limit the efficient identification as well as the subsequent diagnosis and treatment of PSCI. With the increasing popularity and optimization of bioassay techniques and equipment, more and more studies have identified potential early warning markers of stroke patients with the development of their cognitive deficits through hematological testing or imaging. Therefore, the application of blood-based biomarkers and imaging techniques is important for the early identification of PSCI. This review focuses on the research progress of the above two testing modalities in PSCI to discuss their vital meanings for disease recognition. It also suggests that the combined application of the two is expected to improve the potential value of early and accurate diagnosis, with a view to providing new ideas for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of PSCI.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/214", "#/texts/215", "#/texts/216", "#/texts/217", "#/texts/218", "#/texts/219", "#/texts/220", "#/texts/221", "#/texts/222", "#/texts/223", "#/texts/224", "#/texts/225", "#/texts/226", "#/texts/227", "#/texts/228", "#/texts/229", "#/texts/230", "#/texts/232", "#/texts/233", "#/texts/234", "#/texts/235", "#/texts/236", "#/texts/237", "#/texts/238", "#/texts/239", "#/texts/240", "#/texts/241", "#/texts/242", "#/texts/243", "#/texts/244"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "5d23509c-8b23-493a-96d9-7b04ff35adfd"}

It affects up to 20% of the population in high-income countries and up to 50% in some low-income countries (\n1\n). The onset of a stroke not only causes damage to the patient's physical functioning, but is often accompanied by a range of complications from mild cognitive impairment to dementia, which are known as post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) (\n2\n). According to previous studies, stroke patients have at least a 5-8 times increased risk of developing cognitive impairment compared to the rest of the population (\n3\n). PSCI refers to a cognitive impairment syndrome that persists for 6 months after a stroke and meets diagnostic criteria (\n4\n). However, its clinical symptoms are often insidious, and even with a standard three-month follow-up evaluation, it is difficult to identify them in a timely and accurate manner (\n5\n). Cognition includes multiple vital functions such as perception, speech, memory, and behavioral decision-making. Hence, the negative impact of PSCI on individuals and society should not be ignored. Besides its own direct damage, PSCI also increases the overall difficulty in the prognosis and rehabilitation of stroke patients, thus slowing down the pace of patients returning to normal life (\n6\n).", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/246", "#/texts/247", "#/texts/248", "#/texts/249", "#/texts/250", "#/texts/251", "#/texts/252", "#/texts/253", "#/texts/254", "#/texts/255", "#/texts/256", "#/texts/257", "#/texts/258"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "5051d698-98fe-4075-b099-7e30cce3fb59"}

These approaches are easily confounded by factors such as age, language proficiency, and educational attainment. Consequently, the evaluation often lacks timeliness, objectivity as well as accuracy. With the constant progress and wide application of clinical testing and imaging technologies, the research on the use of hematological testing and imaging interpretation in the field of non-organic diseases, such as cognitive and mood disorders, is becoming more and more in-depth (\n7\n-\n9\n). Accumulating evidence indicates that, in patients with PSCI, expression levels of specific protein factors in the blood are tightly correlated with the severity of cognitive dysfunction, which may be a potential biomarker for early prediction of disease onset (\n10\n,\n11\n). Meanwhile, neuroimaging techniques, including structural MRI and functional MRI, also play an important role in evaluating brain changes in patients with cognitive impairment (\n12\n). However, the objective diagnostic indicators and modalities for PSCI are still unclear. Therefore, finding reliable biomarkers and diagnostic tools is crucial in order to achieve early identification and timely intervention of PSCI.\nIn this review, we synthesize current evidence on the application of blood-based biomarkers and imaging techniques for the early recognition of PSCI. Following an overview of the respective advantages and limitations of each testing modality, we critically discuss how their integration strengthens the diagnostic accuracy of PSCI.

Existing evidence suggests that the prevalence of stroke varies significantly depending on diagnostic criteria, evaluation time points, and population characteristics: an international multicenter cohort study reported an overall prevalence of 38% in the first year after stroke (\n13\n). In a large-scale cross-sectional survey covering 30 provinces in China, it was found that the prevalence of PSCI in elderly patients can reach as high as 78.7% (\n14\n). Although there is heterogeneity in incidence rate reported in different studies, for PSCI patients, the superposition effect generated by the interaction between cerebrovascular injury and cognitive degradation not only further aggravates the pathological process, but also challenges the effect of clinical treatment and reduces the effectiveness of intervention measures. The epidemiological data of PSCI once again highlights its global public health burden and its profound impact on the health of the elderly population (\n14\n).

Although current research is constantly deepening in an attempt to reveal its specific mechanisms, the exact pathophysiology of PSCI has not yet been fully clarified. According to existing research, the potential pathological basis of PSCI includes white matter damage, blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, neuroinflammation, cerebral hypoperfusion, and other pathological effects (\n15\n-\n19\n). Among them, white matter hyperintensity caused by cerebral vascular injury often indicates a decline in patients' cognitive function, especially in executive function, attention, language, and visuospatial abilities (\n20\n). The BBB serves as the brain's primary defensive shield. Once compromised, it permits circulating toxins and inflammatory mediators to penetrate the brain, amplifying neuronal and axonal injury and further leading to cognitive impairment (\n21\n,\n22\n). In addition, neuroinflammation, as another important influencing factor of PSCI, the activation of glial cells and the release of inflammatory factors may cause neural death or dysfunction, thereby leading to the occurrence of cognitive impairment in patients (\n23\n,\n24\n). These studies also imply the important application potential of detecting biological indicators and brain tissue morphological and functional changes to identify PSCI-related pathological changes. Therefore, we further summarize and discuss the research progress of serum and imaging techniques related to PSCI.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/283", "#/texts/284", "#/texts/285", "#/texts/286", "#/texts/287", "#/texts/288", "#/texts/289", "#/texts/290", "#/texts/291", "#/texts/292", "#/texts/293", "#/texts/294", "#/texts/295", "#/texts/296", "#/texts/297"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "ee22190d-61f6-4b66-b9da-ab8082ef1818"}

This method is highly sensitive in reflecting critical physiological and pathological processes such as neuronal injury, inflammatory response, and metabolic status in patients. Consequently, it provides a timely biological basis for assessing disease progression.

When neurons are damaged, it is released into the cerebrospinal fluid and blood. Therefore, the level of NfL in the serum will change to some extent after neuronal injury. In recent years, numerous studies have shown that the expression level of NfL is closely related to neurodegenerative diseases (\n25\n-\n27\n). Wu et al. (\n28\n) found that the serum NfL level in PSCI patients was significantly higher than that in the healthy control group, and it was positively correlated with the severity of cognitive impairment, indicating that NfL could be a potentially sensitive indicator for reflecting early neuronal injury and the progression of cognitive impairment. A large-sample prospective cohort study was also shown that the concentration of plasma NfL within 48 h after stroke is an independent risk factor for the occurrence of PSCI at 90 days after onset (\n29\n). These studies all suggest the high predictive value and specificity of NfL for PSCI, which warrants further exploration.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/299", "#/texts/302", "#/texts/303", "#/texts/304", "#/texts/305", "#/texts/306", "#/texts/307", "#/texts/308", "#/texts/309", "#/texts/310"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "2bfa0804-9f82-4ccd-8a86-9a054465fd28"}

In a longitudinal study in 2022, it was found that the assessment of blood phosphorylated-tau181 levels can effectively predict the risk of PSCI at 3 and 12 months after stroke (\n33\n). Notably, Tau protein detected in peripheral blood is predominantly of non-neuronal origin. This underscores the importance of precisely identifying brain-derived Tau protein for predicting CNS disorders, thereby enhancing the clinical relevance and diagnostic potential of peripheral blood biomarkers. In this regard, Gonzalez-Ortiz et al. developed a highly sensitive detection method that selectively binds to brain-derived Tau protein, thereby avoiding the interference of the \"big Tau\" subtype expressed peripherally, and this blood-based brain-derived Tau protein detection method has been verified in multiple independent cohorts (\n34\n). Moreover, the researcher also demonstrated that serum BD-tau concentrations were on average 40% lower than those measured in matched plasma samples, underscoring the critical importance of standardizing specimen type when quantifying this biomarker (\n35\n). Although Tau protein is now established as a pivotal biomarker in Alzheimer's disease (AD), evidence supporting its clinical utility in PSCI remains limited. Nevertheless, the pathophysiological overlap between PSCI and AD provides a compelling rationale for further investigation into the diagnostic and prognostic relevance of Tau in PSCI.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/312", "#/texts/313", "#/texts/314", "#/texts/315", "#/texts/316", "#/texts/317", "#/texts/318", "#/texts/319", "#/texts/320", "#/texts/321", "#/texts/322"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "221de52b-11fd-448d-82a3-7ea9a5c50265"}

Its aberrant elevation serves as a key clinical biomarker for the identification and diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases (\n36\n). An increasing number of studies have focused on the potential role of A\u03b2 in PSCI (\n37\n,\n38\n). A decline in plasma A\u03b21-42 levels 3 months after stroke constitutes the most significant independent predictor of PSCI at 1 year (\n38\n). In a prospective survey by Kang et al., it was found that A\u03b2, produced by the enzymatic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein, is an important predictor of the development of PSCI and cognitive decline over 1 year (\n39\n). Although the determination of A\u03b2 levels in the blood has the advantages of being minimally invasive, rapid, and economical as a biomarker for PSCI, its clinical application is still challenged by BBB, the low concentration of A\u03b2 in the blood, and potential interference from other proteins in the blood (\n40\n).

BDNF exerts its biological functions by binding to its specific receptor tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) and subsequently activating downstream signaling pathways. This cascade of events enables BDNF to perform a variety of critical biological functions, including enhancing synaptic plasticity, promoting neurogenesis, and supporting cell survival (\n43\n). Previous research has demonstrated that serum BDNF levels are significantly diminished in patients with dementia, with severe cognitive impairment being closely associated with reduced BDNF concentrations (\n44\n). Additionally, stroke patients have been found to exhibit a significant decrease in serum BDNF expression (\n45\n). These findings collectively suggest that BDNF may serve as a potential biomarker for evaluating the risk of PSCI. In a clinical study by Chang et al., it was shown that elevated serum BDNF levels are associated with a lower risk of PSCI at 3 months (\n46\n).

The TREM family includes TREM-1, TREM-2, TREM-3, etc., which mediate cell signal transduction by recognizing different ligands and thereby participate in the functional regulation of cells. Among them, the role of TREM-2 in stroke and PSCI has attracted much attention. In a large-sample community survey in Japan, the elevated serum TREM-2 levels are significantly associated with neurodegenerative diseases in the elderly population (\n70\n).

Functional MRI, which reflects brain function through blood oxygen level dependent signal fluctuations, serves as a sensitive biomarker for PSCI by quantifying regional activation and functional connectivity alterations within cognition-relevant networks (\n8\n,\n114\n). This was also verified in a study by Miao et al. (\n115\n). Based on resting state functional MRI, Han K et al.'s study revealed the potential neural mechanisms of PSCI from a mechanistic perspective (\n116\n). In addition, Hoffmann M proposed that Single-photon emission CT (SPECT) is more sensitive than structural neuroimaging techniques in identifying PSCI (\n117\n). Previous research has also found through SPECT that there are perfusion abnormalities in the brains of patients with cognitive impairment after thalamic stroke (\n118\n). Besides, positron emission tomography (PET) can assess brain glucose metabolism using radioactively labeled glucose analogs (such as 18F-FDG). The technique facilitates the identification of metabolic disorders linked to cognitive impairment and provides insights into the relationship between neuroinflammation and amyloid deposition in PSCI (\n119\n). Deep learning models based on PET data have also been used to identify objective biomarkers of cognitive impairment in patients with cerebrovascular disease (\n120\n).\nIn conclusion, both structural and functional imaging techniques have been increasingly recognized for their value in assessing PSCI. Their combination can provide a more comprehensive brain network perspective for patient diagnosis and treatment. With the progress of imaging techniques and the development of analytical methods, their application prospects in the diagnosis and research of neurological diseases will become even broader.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/514", "#/texts/515", "#/texts/516", "#/texts/517", "#/texts/518", "#/texts/519", "#/texts/520", "#/texts/521", "#/texts/522", "#/texts/523", "#/texts/524", "#/texts/525", "#/texts/526", "#/texts/527", "#/texts/528", "#/texts/529", "#/texts/530", "#/texts/531", "#/texts/532", "#/texts/533"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "659ed9f6-f1ad-4676-aea4-0ddad311635a"}

Both blood-based testing from the molecular information level and neuroimaging assessment from the perspective of brain function and structural changes have demonstrated their unique advantages and significance. In previous study, it was pointed out that changes in different blood indicators are correlated with different characteristics of neurodegenerative diseases (\n121\n). Kulesh et al. (\n60\n) also demonstrated that cognitive performance in PSCI tightly correlates with both cytokine signatures and structural-functional brain alterations, and that their synergistic integration may form a more powerful and informative biomarker panel for predicting PSCI. The combination of the two types of detection indicators seems to be a more efficient informational biomarker for predicting PSCI. Similarly, compared with single-indicator assessment, the combination of serum NfL levels and brain infarct volume and white matter hyperintensity detected by imaging has better predictive value for PSCI (\n122\n). In recent years, researchers have successfully identified potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for ischemic stroke by integrating neuroimaging, behavioral studies, and proteomic information from non-human primates (\n123\n).", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/535", "#/texts/536", "#/texts/537", "#/texts/538", "#/texts/539", "#/texts/540", "#/texts/541", "#/texts/542", "#/texts/543"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "08b5fb43-bc3d-45ef-b2af-55ff7a0b5e20"}

At the same time, neuroimaging techniques show significant advantages in tracking long-term changes in brain structure and function (\n125\n). The dynamic changes of these clinical indicators are crucial for predicting and assessing patients' conditions, especially for asymptomatic patient groups. Therefore, finding timely and accurate biomarkers is key to early disease prediction. Although combining blood-based biomarkers and neuroimaging techniques could more comprehensively reveal the pathological mechanisms of PSCI, there are still many challenges in practice, including the selection of application indicators, standardization of techniques, and data analysis methods. To tackle these challenges, it is imperative to establish large-scale, multicenter databases.

However, current diagnostic methods generally suffer from insufficient objectivity and low efficiency. Hence, the application value of blood-based biomarker testing and neuroimaging techniques in the diagnosis of PSCI is increasingly prominent. Based on existing research findings, this review systematically summarizes the current application of these two auxiliary examination methods, fully explains their unique advantages, and the potential efficacy of their combined use. Starting from the biological molecular dimension, blood-based biomarkers can accurately assess the degree of neuronal injury, immune-inflammatory response, and oxidative metabolic levels related to the disease. Neuroimaging techniques, on the other hand, focus on the brain structure and function to meticulously monitor its microscopic pathological changes. Both provide key reference indicators for the early diagnosis and prediction of PSCI, greatly enriching clinical diagnostic information. The synergy between blood-based biomarkers and neuroimaging techniques represents an innovative opportunity in the clinical diagnosis and treatment of PSCI (see in\nFigure 1\n). However, it also poses new challenges to traditional diagnostic and treatment models. Future research must be systematically intensified to enhance the synergistic integration of technical platforms, expedite the iterative refinement of clinical diagnostic criteria, and mitigate the global disease burden of PSCI, thereby optimizing patient outcomes and quality of life.\nFigure 1\nFigure 1\n.
