As dementia becomes more widespread, it is crucial to investigate the underlying mechanisms that contribute to cognitive decline. C-C chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) has been extensively researched for its role in immune responses and function as a co-receptor in HIV infection. Current research indicates that CCR5, which acts as a regulator of synaptic plasticity, is involved in modulating various forms of learning and memory. Most studies suggest that CCR5 generally has a detrimental effect on diseases associated with dementia. This review seeks to deliver an extensive analysis of CCR5's role in cognitive processes by summarizing existing literature from both animal and human studies. It will cover the involvement of CCR5 in standard learning and memory functions, as well as in various types of dementia. The review will specifically address conditions such as HIV-related neurocognitive impairment (HAND), Alzheimer's disease (AD), stroke, vascular dementia, multiple sclerosis (MS), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD). Based on the fact that CCR5 plays a contributing role in many diseases that cause dementia, this review also proposed CCR5 inhibition as a possible target for alleviating and ameliorating dementia.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/222", "#/texts/223", "#/texts/224", "#/texts/225", "#/texts/226", "#/texts/227", "#/texts/228", "#/texts/229", "#/texts/230", "#/texts/231", "#/texts/232", "#/texts/234", "#/texts/235", "#/texts/236", "#/texts/237", "#/texts/238", "#/texts/239", "#/texts/240", "#/texts/241", "#/texts/242"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "3c889bdf-43ad-43a4-972e-5dd63f354e53"}

It results from various primary neurologic, neuropsychiatric, and medical conditions, often involving multiple contributing diseases (\n1\n). With more than 55 million individuals impacted worldwide and nearly 10 million new cases emerging each year, the global prevalence of dementia is projected to increase to 152.8 million by 2050. In China alone, approximately 15 million people over 60 years live with dementia, representing a quarter of the global total (\n2\n).\nAdvancing age, genetic factors, systemic vascular diseases, and infections are key risk factors for dementia (\n3\n-\n5\n). Dementia is often categorized into neurodegenerative and non-neurodegenerative diseases (\nTable 1\n), with neurodegenerative conditions being the predominant cause. Mixed dementia, involving different elements, is also common (\n1\n). Proinflammatory biomarkers correlate with the extent of cognitive deterioration. The hippocampus, crucial for memory and learning, is especially vulnerable to neural impairments due to inflammation, owing to its elevated inflammatory marker expression (\n6\n). Among these markers are Interleukin-1\n\u03b1\n(IL-1\u03b1), Interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF\u03b1), and CCL2, contributing to microglial activation, synaptic irregularities, cognitive decline, and hindered adult neurogenesis (\n7\n,\n8\n).\nTable 1\nTable 1\n.

Because of its important function in the immune system, CCR5 expression is observed in various immune cells (\n15\n). In the central nervous system (CNS), CCR5 is highly enriched in many brain regions, including the CA1 region of the hippocampus and cortex (\n16\n). The hippocampus and cortex are essential for acquiring, consolidating, and retrieving episodic and spatial memories, which contribute to cognitive development. Compared with astrocytes and neurons, CCR5 is expressed more in microglia in the CNS (\n17\n). CCR5 is thought to be involved in the immunological processes and inflammation within the CNS. However, some evidence shows that CCR5 activation may also influence brain functions beyond immune responses, potentially affecting brain development and neuronal transmission. CCR5 interacts with several ligands, including CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, CCL8, CCL11, CCL14a, and CCL16 (\n18\n).\nFigure 1\nFigure 1\n. CCR5 belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors characterized by seven transmembrane domains, along with three extracellular and three intracellular loops. The extracellular N-terminus, positioned on the outer surface of the plasma membrane, serves as the principal site for chemokine ligand recognition and initial interaction. Extracellular loop regions cooperate with both the N-terminal domain and transmembrane segments to maintain the stability of the ligand-receptor complex, while also mediating structural rearrangements following ligand engagement to facilitate signal propagation across the membrane. The seven transmembrane \u03b1-helical bundles undergo spatial reorientation upon ligand binding, resulting in receptor activation through transition from a resting to an activated conformation - an essential mechanistic event in signal transduction. The intracellular loop structures function as molecular relays, conveying structural alterations from the transmembrane core to downstream intracellular signaling molecules. These loops additionally contain phosphorylation motifs targeted by GPCR kinases, playing pivotal roles in processes such as receptor desensitization and subsequent internalization.

It is considered a significant inhibitor of neuronal plasticity in the hippocampus and cortex, thereby diminishing learning and memory capabilities (\n16\n). CCR5 affects these cognitive functions by modulating the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) (\n19\n,\n20\n) and cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) (\n19\n,\n21\n,\n22\n) signaling pathways, which are crucial for hippocampal learning, memory, and cortical plasticity. Disruption of CCR5 function leads to increased levels of MAPK and CREB during learning, which boosts synaptic plasticity, and long-term potentiation (LTP) (\n23\n), and improves hippocampal learning and memory. Conversely, overexpression of CCR5 results in deficits in these cognitive areas. While CCR5 knockout does not alter MAPK or CREB signaling under baseline conditions, it increases their levels after training. This enhanced signaling correlates with improved learning and memory. In line with its effects on MAPK/CREB signaling, CCR5 knockout also enhances LTP in the hippocampal CA1 region and improves performance in diverse recognition tasks (\n16\n). Inhibition of CCR5 with maraviroc, similar to genetic CCR5 ablation, also enhances contextual memory in rats following fear conditioning training (\n24\n). In middle-aged mice, the administration of maraviroc to block CCR5 alleviated deficits related to memory linkage (\n21\n). This finding aligns with the notion that reducing CCR5 levels can enhance learning and memory. In contrast, transgenic mice with CCR5 overexpressed in excitatory neurons exhibited impaired learning and memory, indicating that CCR5 serves an inhibitory function in neuronal plasticity and memory processes.\nTable 2\nTable 2\n.

These effects can be counteracted by maraviroc, a CCR5 antagonist. Notably, maraviroc also completely prevents CCL3-induced impairments in long-term potentiation (LTP). Importantly, maraviroc does not affect plasticity in the absence of CCL3 activation, indicating that CCR5's tonic activity alone does not influence synaptic plasticity (\n25\n). During the contextual memory linking test, the CCL5 group exhibited diminished contextual memory linking, reflecting that increased CCR5 activity impairs this process. Likewise, CCL5 knockout (Ccl5\u2212/\u2212) mice, like CCR5 knockout (Ccr5\u2212/\u2212) mice, displayed a prolonged linking window, underscoring the importance of CCL5 in regulating CCR5's role in memory linking.

This process involves CCR5-mediated secretion of cytokines like TNF-\n\u03b1\n, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6, observed in astrocytes stimulated with the HIV-1 protein gp120 (\n36\n). The interaction of HIV-1/gp120 with CCR5 on microglia leads to their activation and subsequent toxin production, which appears crucial for causing significant neurodegeneration. Kaul et al. demonstrated that gp120-induced neurotoxicity was significantly decreased when microglia were either removed or inactivated in mixed neuronal/glial cerebrocortical cultures (\n37\n). This finding highlights the crucial role of microglial receptors CCR5 in mediating neurotoxicity. The data suggest that microglia are important for the neurotoxic effects of gp120, indicating that these cells, through their interaction with HIV-1 coreceptors, are central to the neurodegenerative processes observed in HAND.\nHIV/gp120 binds to CCR5 and CD4, activating microglia and macrophages via the p38MAPK signaling pathway (\nFigure 2\n). This activation leads to the release of neurotoxic substances such as glutamate (\n38\n) and inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\n\u03b1\n, IL-1\u03b2), which further stimulate adjacent glial cells like astrocytes (\n39\n). These astrocytes release more inflammatory cytokines (\n40\n) and nitric oxide (NO), forming peroxynitrite (ONOO-), which is neurotoxic (\n41\n). Glutamate release from microglia/macrophages causes excessive activation of the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR), leading to harmful intracellular signals, and eventually, neurons may undergo necrosis or apoptosis. Additionally, CCR5 knockout or CCR5 antagonists in HIV mouse models reduce microglial activation and accumulation, preventing gp120-induced spatial memory deficits (\n42\n).\nFigure 2", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/363", "#/texts/364", "#/texts/365", "#/texts/366", "#/texts/367", "#/texts/368", "#/texts/369", "#/texts/370", "#/texts/371", "#/texts/372", "#/texts/373", "#/texts/374", "#/texts/375", "#/texts/376", "#/texts/377", "#/texts/378", "#/texts/379", "#/texts/380", "#/texts/381", "#/texts/382", "#/texts/383", "#/texts/384", "#/texts/385"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "1e5cec19-4137-4874-99a5-159411c207de"}

However, its biological functions are now recognized to extend beyond this scope. Research has indicated that CCR5 may negatively influence memory circuits and synaptic plasticity (\n16\n). Activation of CCR5 can impact neuronal function by inhibiting CREB or MAPK, reducing synaptic plasticity, and hindering axonal regeneration following neuronal injury (\n16\n,\n62\n). Although microglia are the principal cells expressing CCR5 in the CNS, the specifics of CCR5's role in neuron-glial interactions during learning remain uncertain. CCL3/4/5 produced by microglia might significantly affect CCR5 function and, consequently, memory cognition (\n21\n,\n59\n). While the majority of studies suggest that CCR5 has a detrimental effect on cognitive functions, there are exceptions, such as in AD and stroke research, where CCR5 loss in mice has been associated with memory impairment.\nNo significant association was found between the CCR5-delta32 polymorphism and dementia (\n84\n). However, it is important to highlight that the statistical power of some studies was limited due to small sample sizes, suggesting that larger cohorts are needed to reliably assess the impact of CCR5-delta32 on dementia. Additionally, population stratification could act as a confounding factor in association studies, as ethnic differences or other variables might influence the frequencies of marker alleles within populations.\nAltogether, the studies suggest that CCR5 could indeed influence cognitive function in dementia beyond the well-studied context of HIV, opening up the potential for CCR5-targeted therapies. While this review focuses on CCR5, it's important to note that other chemokine receptors also impact cognition. Given that CCR5 and similar receptors share ligands and signaling pathways, a deeper understanding of their roles in learning and memory could pave the way for effective treatments for cognitive impairments in various conditions like HAND and AD.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/550", "#/texts/551", "#/texts/552", "#/texts/553", "#/texts/554", "#/texts/555", "#/texts/556", "#/texts/557", "#/texts/558", "#/texts/559", "#/texts/560", "#/texts/561", "#/texts/562", "#/texts/563", "#/texts/564"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "dc9b8db2-ddfc-4a56-a627-8fc289a32d8b"}
