Recent studies have shown that combining aerobic exercise (AE) and meditation (ME) effectively enhances both physical and cognitive functions in individuals with CF. The study aims to determine whether the combined application of AE and ME can elicit significantly greater improvements in physical and cognitive functions among individuals with CF compared with the independent practice of either AE or ME alone.\nMethods and analysis\nThe research design employs a four-arm, assessor-blind randomised controlled trial. A total of 140 qualified subjects will be randomly allocated among four groups: AE, ME, AE combined with ME and a health education control group, ensuring equivalent distribution across groups. The intervention phase of the study will last for 12 weeks. The primary outcomes will include the Edmonton Frailty Scale, while secondary outcomes will encompass evaluations of cognitive functions (including global cognitive function, memory, attention, executive function and visuospatial abilities), physical performance (measured by gait speed and lower extremity strength), subjective experiences (such as fatigue, quality of life, mindfulness, mood and sleep quality), as well as structural and functional MRI assessments and serum biomarkers. Outcomes will be evaluated at baseline and following the 12-week intervention.\nEthics and dissemination\nThe Ethics Committee of the Affiliated Rehabilitation Hospital of the Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine granted ethical approval for the study (2023KY-012-02). The findings will be disseminated through publications in peer-reviewed journals and presentations at academic conferences.\nTrial registration number\nChiCTR2300073563.\n- Exercise\n- Cognition\n- Frailty\n- Randomized Controlled Trial", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/54", "#/texts/55", "#/texts/56", "#/texts/57", "#/texts/58", "#/texts/59", "#/texts/60", "#/texts/61", "#/texts/62", "#/texts/63", "#/texts/64", "#/texts/65"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "d927d16e-cbcf-471d-afe7-f87e71f8eb05"}

The latest 'Chinese Expert Consensus on Cognitive Frailty Rehabilitation 2023' emphasises that physical exercise, particularly AE, should be regarded as the foundational element of non-pharmacological interventions.\n6\nSeveral systematic reviews have demonstrated that regular exercise not only improves physical functions, such as muscle strength, gait speed and balance, but also enhances cognitive functions in CF.\n7-9\nMeditation (ME) is a training that cultivates improved attention control, emotional regulation and self-awareness.\n10 11\nMultiple studies have shown significant benefits of ME in enhancing attention, executive function and working memory in older adults.\n12-14\nNonetheless, CF manifests as a complex clinical condition encompassing both cognitive and physical impairments. The effectiveness of a single rehabilitation approach is limited, indicating that a comprehensive programme incorporating multiple interventions may produce superior outcomes. Previous research has demonstrated that Baduanjin exercise, which integrates AE and ME, yields more effective outcomes in enhancing physical and cognitive functions,\n15\nmodulating the structural plasticity of the hippocampal subregion\n16\nand reducing oxidative stress and inflammation in older adults with CF.\n17\nFurthermore, the findings suggest that a combined programme incorporating tai chi and mindfulness practices results in superior improvements in both cognitive and physical capabilities among elderly individuals with CF, compared with implementing either tai chi or mindfulness training in isolation.\n18\nTherefore, it is proposed that a combination of AE and ME produces a synergistic effect that significantly benefits CF in older adults.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/88", "#/texts/89", "#/texts/90", "#/texts/91", "#/texts/92", "#/texts/93", "#/texts/94", "#/texts/95", "#/texts/96", "#/texts/97", "#/texts/98", "#/texts/99", "#/texts/100", "#/texts/101", "#/texts/102", "#/texts/103", "#/texts/104", "#/texts/105", "#/texts/106", "#/texts/107", "#/texts/108", "#/texts/109", "#/texts/110", "#/texts/111", "#/texts/112", "#/texts/113", "#/texts/114"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "84325705-6632-4a69-9fbe-1d767feed4ef"}

These mechanisms include increasing neuron growth factor levels,\n37-39\naugmenting hippocampal synaptic activity and positively influencing the connectivity and function of various brain regions.\n40-45\nFurthermore, AE has been demonstrated to mitigate age-related oxidative damage\n46-49\nand reduce chronic inflammation.\n50-54\nBesides, ME has the potential to enhance cognitive and physical functioning by decreasing the activation and responsiveness of the sympathoadrenal system and the HPA axis,\n55\nwhile also promoting various beneficial effects on cognition and associated inflammatory responses.\n56-58\nME can specifically activate certain neurochemical systems and brain regions.\n59 60\nMoreover, ME may contribute to telomere maintenance and mitigate the effects of stress-induced cellular ageing by potentially stimulating increased telomerase activity.\n61-63\nTherefore, it is reasonable to assume that AE combined with ME may potentially enhance both physical and cognitive functions in the CF. To minimise bias, this trial will implement stringent methods, including randomisation, parallel control groups and blinding of both outcome assessors and statisticians. In addition to the primary outcome measures of frailty index, this investigation examines diverse factors to explore potential mechanisms. These encompass assessments of neuropsychological performance, physical activity levels, serum biomarkers and neuroimaging.\nFor this protocol, a significant limitation is the absence of double blinding, which could potentially introduce detection bias. Nonetheless, to mitigate bias and maintain trial integrity, those responsible for assessing outcomes, managing data and conducting statistical analyses will be blinded to the intervention. An additional limitation is the lack of long-term follow-up evaluations, precluding evaluation of the long-term effects. However, the intervention duration of 12\u2009weeks aligns with real-world clinical application and is sufficient to evaluate the intervention's short-term efficacy.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/288", "#/texts/289", "#/texts/290", "#/texts/291", "#/texts/292", "#/texts/293", "#/texts/294", "#/texts/295", "#/texts/296", "#/texts/297", "#/texts/298", "#/texts/299", "#/texts/300", "#/texts/301", "#/texts/302", "#/texts/303", "#/texts/304", "#/texts/305"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "10791d88-abb8-4a6d-8170-dc86fc46608a"}

Should this study be completed successfully with notable results, it will help determine the most effective non-pharmacological intervention for CF and potentially uncover underlying mechanisms through neuroimaging and serum physiology. Furthermore, the study will offer credible evidence supporting the combination of AE and ME training programs within communities of older adults experiencing CF.\n\nEffect of aerobic exercise combined with meditation on cognitive frailty: study protocol for a parallel group randomised controlled trial | BMJ Open\nData availability statement\nData are available upon reasonable request.\n\nEffect of aerobic exercise combined with meditation on cognitive frailty: study protocol for a parallel group randomised controlled trial | BMJ Open\nEthics statements\nPatient consent for publication\nConsent obtained directly from patient(s).\n\nEffect of aerobic exercise combined with meditation on cognitive frailty: study protocol for a parallel group randomised controlled trial | BMJ Open\nEthics statements\nEthics approval\nThis study involves human participants and was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Affiliated Rehabilitation Hospital of the Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (2023KY-012-02).
