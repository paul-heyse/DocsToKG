Clinical features of LBDs can include parkinsonian motor symptoms, cognitive decline and neuropsychiatric symptoms such as visual hallucinations, and sleep disorders [ 2 , 3 ]. Alongside core features, LBDs are typically accompanied by a high volume of supportive symptoms that add to clinical complexity. Affective symptoms, namely anxiety, apathy and depression, are common and debilitating supportive features of LBDs [ 4 ]. Such symptoms are highly prevalent in neurodegenerative conditions [ 5 ] and particularly common in PDD and DLB when compared with other dementia subtypes [ 6 - 8 ]. Furthermore, anxiety, apathy and depression in LBD have been identified as some of the primary symptoms associated with reductions in quality of life [ 9 - 13 ] and increases in cognitive decline [ 14 - 19 ], motor symptom severity [ 9 , 20 , 21 ], and caregiver burden [ 22 , 23 ].\nDespite their prevalence, the underlying mechanisms of affective symptoms in LBD remain poorly understood. Moreover, most research examining the neural correlates of neuropsychiatric symptoms in LBD has been conducted primarily in cognitively healthy PD, excluding the cognitively impaired LBD groups that these symptoms most frequently affect [ 24 , 25 ]. This exemption of cognitively impaired cohorts from the literature is of particular significance given the established pathophysiological differences between cognitively healthy PD, at one end of the LBD spectrum, and the dementia syndromes of PDD and DLB at the other, which may include a greater burden of AD co-pathology and a more severe cholinergic degeneration [ 26 - 28 ]. Given the well-established association between affective symptoms and cognitive decline [ 14 - 17 , 19 ], the relative paucity of research in Lewy body dementias (PDD and DLB) represents a distinct gap in the literature.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/55", "#/texts/56"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "2abc70e7-5af3-455e-b550-a173cf6fef1d"}

In the wider psychiatric literature, affective states related to psychiatric disorders have been postulated to result from specific changes in functional connectivity both within and between intrinsic resting-state networks relating to impairments in neurotransmission, such as those characteristic of LBDs [ 37 ]. Moreover, converging evidence suggesting that certain brain regions, such as the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex, play a significant role in mood disorders [ 38 ], has similarly been reflected in neuroimaging studies of such symptoms in cognitively healthy PD and neuropathological studies of DLB [ 39 - 41 ]. Neural correlates of anxiety and apathy have shown similar convergence across psychiatric and PD literature, suggesting that LBDs may exacerbate mechanisms underlying affective symptoms, resulting in an increased prevalence among these patient groups [ 29 , 42 ]. What remains unclear however, are the specific neuropathological changes contributing to the increased severity and prevalence of affective symptoms in the context of cognitive decline.\nAlthough DLB and PDD are may be considered two clinically distinct entities, the historical debate regarding their nosological distinction is ongoing [ 43 , 44 ]. Both DLB and PDD are underpinned by similar pathophysiological processes [ 45 , 46 ] and clinical profiles [ 3 , 47 ] to the extent that both may be preceded by a prodromal period of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) [ 48 , 49 ]. In clinical practice, a rather arbitrary 'one year rule' defines PDD based on the initial appearance of motor symptoms at least one year prior to cognitive decline, although no symptoms definitively distinguish PDD from DLB at the dementia stages [ 50 ]. The present review therefore examines the PDD and DLB literature in aggregate, including studies of prodromal MCI groups, to synthesise current evidence regarding neural correlates of affective symptoms across the spectrum of Lewy body dementias.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/57", "#/texts/58"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "fa98dac0-3223-4cab-ad03-89bf342ed491"}

Most studies (17/18) included a measure of depression with far fewer investigating anxiety or apathy. As such, significant findings were predominantly limited to this symptom, with only two studies highlighting significant findings related to anxiety in cognitively impaired PD or DLB and only two highlighting a significant finding related to apathy in DLB.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/108", "#/texts/109"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "d30ddceb-cdc1-438f-b052-fc058cee799b"}

[ 58 ] identified multiple regions of both higher and lower grey matter volume in several disparate brain regions among PD-MCI with depression when compared to those without. Although some previous studies have identified positive correlations between depression and volumetric or cortical thickness measures in PD [ 70 , 71 ], such positive associations are at odds with a range of imaging research that has typically highlighted lower grey matter volume within limbic, prefrontal and insular regions, in depressed PD groups [ 25 , 72 ]. Chang et al.'s study further highlighted a possible breakdown in structural covariance within the salience network in the depressed PD-MCI group compared with the non-depressed group. Such findings may align with functional connectivity analyses of major depressive disorder [ 73 ], and even PD-MCI [ 64 ], in which hypoconnectivity of the salience network has been found to relate to depression.

In Wright et al.'s (2025) fMRI study, positive correlations between both 'affective disorder' and anxiety severity and functional connectivity were identified particularly between the limbic orbitofrontal cortex, subgenual cingulate, and regions of the DMN. Conversely, negative correlations were found between affective symptom severity and connectivity between the orbitofrontal cortex and the brainstem and between the subgenual cingulate and the salience network. In Zhang et al.'s [ 62 ] study, depression severity was additionally found to positively correlate with connectivity of the nucleus basalis of Meynert. Such findings by Wright et al. reflect those of previous research in cognitively healthy PD groups [ 39 , 40 ], and literature from the broader psychiatric field, highlighting the significant involvement of the subgenual cingulate, limbic regions and imbalanced activity across the DMN and salience network in depression and anxiety disorders [ 37 , 38 ]. This contributes towards a hypothesis that aberrant functional network connectivity may be a core underlying mechanism of neuropsychiatric symptoms in PD that is likely heavily influenced by LBD related changes in multiple neurotransmission pathways such as the serotonergic and dopaminergic systems [ 32 , 34 , 35 ]. The findings by Zhang and colleagues further highlight a significant association between depression severity and connectivity between the cholinergic basal forebrain and cingulate cortex, a brain region frequently implicated in PD related affective symptoms [ 40 , 64 , 75 , 76 ]. Earlier reviews of cholinergic deficits in PD have highlighted a potential connection between depression as a risk-factor for cognitive decline in PD and cholinergic dysfunction [ 77 ]. Given both early and recent discoveries suggesting an important role of the cholinergic system in mood regulation [ 78 ], and the increased cholinergic denervation associated with LBD cognitive decline [ 27 ], this finding warrants further investigation as a possible mechanism underlying the observable relationship between cognitive decline and increasing affective symptom severity in LBDs [ 14 - 19 ].", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/111"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "d5c9f1e0-64c9-4f9b-a5bc-f3ccaa3646f0"}

Of the 11 studies that included a DLB or MCI-LB group, six reported significant findings. Studies in DLB primarily utilized SPECT imaging to assess neurotransmission, with five investigating striatal DAT binding and one investigating the density of VAchT binding within cholinergic pathways. Conversely, none of the studies in cognitively impaired PD groups utilized such neurotransmission imaging techniques, possibly due to a wealth of research already providing evidence for a role of dopaminergic, serotonergic and noradrenergic denervation underlying affective symptoms in cognitively healthy PD [ 79 ]. In contrast with PD research that has shown significant correlations between anxiety, apathy and depression and DAT binding [ 29 , 34 , 80 ], evidence from DLB groups is sparse. Although two of the five DAT imaging studies identified some significant negative correlations between DAT binding in the striatum and either depression, apathy or anxiety in DLB ([ 36 , 55 ], others reported a lack of significant association with any affective symptom [ 52 , 54 , 56 ]. Furthermore, Roselli et al. [ 36 ] demonstrated significant associations between depression and apathy and DAT binding within the caudate but found no association with anxiety. Conversely, Yoo et al. [ 55 ] found only anxiety significantly correlated with DAT binding in the ventral striatum while apathy and depression were not associated with binding in any striatal region. Explanations for such discrepancies may lie in the substantial differences in study methodology, including imaging tracer and technique, diagnostic protocols, region of interest definition, and covariates in the analysis. Regardless, the directionality of results is consistent across both studies, with dopaminergic activity deficits within the striatum relating to manifestations of affective symptoms in DLB. Such findings are supported by neuropathological studies in DLB which have highlighted degeneration of dopaminergic pathways in depressed patients [ 31 , 41 ], as well as neuroimaging studies in both cognitively healthy PD and other psychiatric and neurocognitive disorders [ 29 , 81 - 83 ].", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/112"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "10cbebea-fd21-42d6-8a1e-ed6d5dba986a"}

Despite the limited sample size of this study, the results align with Zhang et al.'s findings [ 62 ] demonstrating a significant association between depression and functional connectivity deficits between the nucleus basalis of Meynert and cingulate cortex in PD-MCI, further highlighting the cholinergic system as an emerging area of interest regarding the pathophysiology of affective symptoms in cognitively impaired LBD.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/113"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "f63e757c-3b66-4eb4-8910-32af9f69b1af"}

Interestingly, Murayama et al.'s study [ 66 ] identified significantly greater regional cerebral blood flow in areas corresponding to the DMN in depressed DLB participants, aligning with the DMN hyperconnectivity associated with affective disorder scores identified in PD-MCI by Wright et al.[ 64 ]. DMN regions were similarly highlighted by Querry et al.'s (2024) structural study in which depression was found to be negatively associated with grey matter volume within the middle frontal gyrus and precuneus. Such associations between depressive symptoms and DMN alterations are well established in the psychiatric literature and in previous studies in cognitively healthy PD [ 38 - 40 ]. Overactivity of the DMN in relation to negative affective states has been hypothesized to result, in part, from dysfunctional dopaminergic circuits [ 37 ], aligning with the denervation and pathological burden within dopaminergic pathways associated with depression in DLB [ 31 , 41 ]. However, it must be noted in this case that such findings were not corroborated by Gan et al.'s\n18\nFDG-PET study [ 65 ] or either of the two fMRI studies in investigating DLB or MCI-LB [ 63 , 64 ]. Rather, Querry et al.'s functional study [ 63 ] identified a range of both positive and negative associations between functional connectivity and depression in their DLB group that were largely located between the orbitofrontal and inferior temporal cortex and regions of the occipital lobe, with little to no involvement of regions associated with the DMN. Negative correlations were also identified between depression severity and within-network connectivity of the salience network. Although this may align with hypothesized contributions of salience network hypoconnectivity to negative affective states [ 37 ], such findings were only identified at an uncorrected threshold and have yet to be replicated. At present, therefore, little corroboration exists within the literature regarding imaging correlates of affective symptoms in DLB.\nStrengths and Limitations", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/114", "#/texts/115", "#/texts/116", "#/texts/117"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "46c93301-d454-478d-967d-379dcff841d6"}

A possible limitation, however, was the decision to exclude electrophysiological techniques, such as electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography, from both the search terms and through screening. The decision to exclude these techniques was made to limit the scope of this review to more easily comparable functional and structural outcome measures. However, such studies may prove beneficial in furthering our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying affective symptoms in LBDs and as such their exclusion may be considered a limitation.\nOne of the main limiting factors of the studies reviewed is that, except for DAT imaging, none of the imaging approaches utilized had been repeated within the same clinical subgroup across more than a single study, providing no opportunity to assess the replicability of the findings. Half of the studies did not identify any significant findings at all, resulting in little corroborating evidence across the literature. Furthermore, only half of the studies reviewed investigated the relationship between affective symptoms and neuroimaging metrics as a primary aim, meaning that not only were hypotheses not formulated around this specific research question, but many studies excluded participants based on the presence of clinically relevant psychiatric symptoms. Currently, therefore, it is hard to reconcile the multiple apparent inconsistencies across neuroimaging studies of affective symptoms in cognitively impaired LBD, given that the evidence base remains so limited.

Of the studies included, only four included an A\u03b2 biomarker and the vast majority of participants were diagnosed based solely on clinical criteria, limiting the possibility to determine pathology specific contributions to affective symptoms. In AD, tau and A\u03b2 burden have not only been directly associated with affective symptoms [ 87 - 89 ], but additionally impact specific neurotransmission systems, such as cholinergic pathways, that have an established role in affective symptom manifestation [ 27 , 78 , 90 ]. The study by Yoo et al.[ 55 ] further replicates the association between affective symptoms and AD pathology in DLB, finding that DLB participants with a high A\u03b2 load demonstrated greater levels of anxiety and overall neuropsychiatric burden than A\u03b2-negative participants.

It is reasonable to predict, therefore, that the same is likely true of manifestations of affective symptoms in such complex and multifactorial conditions as Lewy body dementia, where a vast range of potential alterations within neurotransmission pathways and brain networks, resultant of either pure or mixed pathologies, may differentially contribute to symptom manifestation in each individual. Such diversity does not only arise from underlying pathology but is further complicated by the significant clinical overlaps not only between affective symptoms themselves but between affective symptoms and other clinical features of LBD such as motor deficits, sleep disturbance and cognitive fluctuations [ 94 - 96 ]. A final substantial limitation of the current literature is therefore the use of a range of heterogeneous affective symptom rating scales, the validity of which have yet to be adequately assessed in the context of Lewy body dementia.
