Among the various types of stem cells, human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) have emerged as a groundbreaking innovation [\n3\n]. Derived from adult somatic cells, such as fibroblasts, hiPSCs can be reprogrammed to a pluripotent state, enabling them to generate virtually any cell type in the body [\n3\n].

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), dementia alone affects approximately 55 million individuals globally, with projections expecting it to rise to 78 million and 139 million by 2030 and 2050, respectively [\n5\n]. These conditions are characterized by the progressive loss of neuronal structure and function, leading to debilitating symptoms such as memory loss, cognitive decline, and motor dysfunction [\n6\n]. Despite decades of research, current treatments for neurodegenerative diseases remain largely palliative, focusing on symptom management rather than addressing the underlying causes of neuronal degeneration [\n7\n,\n8\n,\n9\n].\n\nStem cell therapy use in patients with dementia: a systematic review\nIntroduction\nLimitations of current therapies\nExisting therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative diseases, such as cholinesterase inhibitors and NMDA receptor antagonists, offer only modest benefits and are often associated with significant side effects, including gastrointestinal disturbances, dizziness, and cognitive worsening [\n9\n,\n10\n,\n11\n]. These treatments do not halt or reverse disease progression, highlighting the urgent need for innovative approaches that target the root causes of neurodegeneration [\n9\n,\n10\n,\n11\n].

Selecting the appropriate cell source and type is crucial for enhancing the success of SCT.

These findings align with the current literature, which suggests that MSCs exert their effects through various mechanisms, such as the release of neurotrophic factors, reduction in amyloid-beta toxicity, and modulation of immune responses [\n56\n]. However, despite consistent evidence of the benefits of MSCs, the precise molecular pathways through which these therapies act remain unclear. While several studies support the neurotrophic effects of MSCs [\n57\n,\n58\n], the complex interaction between these factors and the neurodegenerative processes in AD needs further investigation.\nCompared to other therapeutic strategies, such as anti-amyloid antibody treatments or small molecule drugs, SCTs offer a more comprehensive approach. Traditional treatments typically target a single pathological mechanism (e.g., amyloid-beta or tau aggregation), while SCTs may address multiple aspects of AD pathology, including neuroinflammation and cell regeneration [\n59\n,\n60\n].

Firstly, the included studies exhibited significant heterogeneity in terms of study design, stem cell types, routes of administration, dosages, and outcome measures. This heterogeneity limited our ability to perform a formal meta-analysis and may have introduced variability in the findings. Additionally, there is a potential for publication bias, as studies with positive results are more likely to be published than those with negative or inconclusive findings, which could lead to an overestimation of the effectiveness of SCT in treating dementia. Ethical and practical constraints may have limited the scope and execution of some studies, particularly in patient recruitment and the use of certain SC types. The absence of longitudinal data tracking patients over extended periods reduces the ability to assess the durability and progression of treatment effects.

Pre-clinical trials using animal models have shown promising results, indicating the potential of SCT in dementia treatment. There is a growing interest in conducting clinical trials to further explore SCT applications in human subjects. However, the outcomes of current clinical trials suggest that significant success in treating complex medical conditions like dementia with SCT has not yet been achieved. Therefore, pre-clinical trials, while informative, may not reliably predict success and efficacy in human clinical trials. Moving forward, there is a critical need for improved clinical trial methodologies and advanced models in stem cell research to delineate the most effective approaches for treating dementia.
