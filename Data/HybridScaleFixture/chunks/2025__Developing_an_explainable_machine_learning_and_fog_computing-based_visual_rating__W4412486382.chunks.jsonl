However, these models often cannot provide early detection of affected brain regions. Alternatively, mental test scores such as the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) offer valuable insights into the likelihood of dementia and cognitive impairments. The main objective of this study is to introduce an innovative and dependable context-aware health monitoring system based on fog computing to measure mental impairment in the elderly population. The framework provides screening tests utilizing MMSE and MoCA to achieve accurate and real-time monitoring of cognitive function, allowing for early detection and treatment of mental disorders. To assess the effectiveness of our screening test, we evaluated a dataset comprising 450 subjects with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) from Kaferelshikh University. The aggregated dataset is categorized into three classes: (1) 150 patients with MCI, (2) 150 subjects with subcortical diseases, Parkinson's Disease (PD), and (3) 150 subjects with cortical diseases, Alzheimer's Disease (AD). To accurately determine health risks, we employ an ensemble AdaBoost model, providing superior performance in accuracy, precision, recall, F-score, and Area Under the Curve (AUC). To validate the effectiveness of our Machine Learning (ML) model on unseen data, we evaluate an additional 18 subjects using the proposed scoring test, with six subjects from each class. The results indicate that our proposed ML model achieves an impressive accuracy of 0.93, outperforming the MoCA score (0.90) and MMSE score (0.83).

Integrating the Internet of Things (IoT) and computing platforms such as fog, edge, and cloud can enhance the quality of healthcare services by enabling various telecom computing solutions. Reliable data collection is one of the biggest challenges in the healthcare industry, and intelligent sensors powered by IoT can help address this challenge seamlessly\n1\n. With recent advancements in IoT and computing platforms, hybrid modules have been created, delivering efficient e-healthcare computing solutions and enabling easy wireless data transfer among different units. Fog computing is a low-cost computing paradigm that extends cloud services to the network's edge. Unlike traditional computing services, fog computing provides massive computational and e-services on-demand, with proximity to end-users. Doing so reduces the latency time, and reliable and effective data are handled\n2\n. Figure\n1\nillustrates the structure of the hybrid model. Furthermore, a comparison of cloud and fog technologies will be conducted in Table\n1\n.\nFig. 1\nMild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is a neurocognitive disorder that affects a significant portion of the elderly population. It is characterized by a slight memory deficit, which often describes a transitional state between Cognitively Normal (CN) and overt dementia, such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Parkinson's Disease (PD). The symptoms of MCI are not severe enough to interfere with daily activities, but they are noticeable enough to cause concern. Memory loss is a common symptom of MCI, but other cognitive functions, such as decision-making, language, and attention, may also be affected\n8\n,\n9\n.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/47", "#/texts/48", "#/texts/49", "#/texts/51", "#/texts/52", "#/texts/53", "#/texts/55", "#/texts/56", "#/texts/57", "#/texts/60", "#/texts/61", "#/texts/62", "#/texts/63", "#/texts/64", "#/texts/65", "#/texts/66", "#/texts/67", "#/texts/68", "#/texts/69", "#/texts/70", "#/texts/71", "#/texts/72", "#/texts/73", "#/texts/74"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "fc7e79e7-b591-4fac-a6b7-4e7a77e6ab50"}

Unfortunately, these outcomes' factors are not fully understood\n11\n. Medical studies exploring the relationship between cognitive impairment and the risk of developing PD or AD have provided valuable insights into these neurodegenerative diseases. While cognitive impairment is strongly associated with AD, PD also presents cognitive symptoms, albeit with a different cognitive profile. Understanding the nature of cognitive impairment and its relationship to specific neurodegenerative diseases is crucial for accurate diagnosis, appropriate management, and targeted interventions to enhance the quality of life for individuals affected by these conditions\n12\n,\n13\n. Although this impact is significant, it is frequently missing in many studies. Some studies mentioned that mild cognitive impairment mainly depends on memory impairment for predicting AD.\nThe available information regarding the correlation between cognitive function in domains other than episodic Memory and the hazard of developing AD is limited. While episodic memory deficits are commonly associated with AD, the impact of different cognitive domains on the risk of developing the disease is not yet fully understood\n14\n,\n15\n. Episodic Memory is defined as the ability to remember specific events or experiences, and it is often one of the first cognitive functions affected in AD. However, AD is a complex neurodegenerative disease that involves impairments in multiple cognitive domains, including language, attention, executive function, and visuospatial abilities. Several studies have provided a detailed analysis of the progression from MCI to AD\n16\n,\n17\n,\n18\n, and they conclude reasons as follows: (i) MCI subject has less significant memory defects than AD, (ii) MCI subjects convert to AD within a range of time.

Every day, health centers produce a lot of data. For ML and DL algorithms to produce reliable results that give patients accurate information and quick outcomes regarding their health, a sizable amount of data is required. In healthcare prospects, the importance of ML and DL lies in their ability to handle enormous datasets more effectively without human intervention, and they improve the overall clinician experience at a lower cost.\nIn the context of early prediction of cognitive decline, ML and DL techniques have been utilized to drive non-traditional and high computational incentive solutions such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\n12\n,\n13\n,\n14\n,\n15\n,\n16\n,\n17\n, biomarkers, and genetic data\n19\n. For example, authors in\n20\nutilized EfficientNet-B2 as a backbone for the building model to predict Alzheimer's disease- dementia. They first used EfficientNet to extract features from retrained images and then used the DL model to train the classification model. The same is true for\n21\n, where they utilized a stratified randomization method to predict cognitive decline. In\n20\n, the authors used a 3d CNN model to make an early diagnosis for Alzheimer's disease. Although the results seem better, they have often exceeded expectations. Due to the Patient's measurements in the diagnosis do not always coincide due to several reasons, including (i) the unavailability of all datasets, (ii) the need for continuous aggregating of patient data to track brain image changes which are expensive, and (iii) several signs don't appear at the early stage of the diseases.

In 1975, Folstein developed a screening tool in clinical research called the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)\n18\n. MMSE is the most common examination designed to detect cognitive dysfunction in different contexts, such as Memory, language, and attention. It allows the physician to determine cognitive ability deterioration as a measure of dementia progression and the influence of pharmaceutical therapies. However, due to the large percentage of a calling effect, there is currently debate whether this method can accurately identify cognitive dysfunction in the early stage. In\n19\n, they investigated MMSE ability as a screening tool for 34 patients with dementia. They concluded that MMSE should be used with extra care due to its mild sensitivity in predicting early deficits of such dementia diseases\n3\n,\n11\n. In 1995, in Montreal, Canada, the researcher developed a new screening tool known as the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) to detect cognitive defects at an early stage\n22\n. MOCA has more sophisticated and broader tasks to check the visuospatial processing, usually in patients with MCI. In\n23\n, five meta-analyses of Parkinson's disease patients were examined to investigate how MOCA and MMSE scores are calculated.

It detects cognitive impairment and estimates cognitive evolution over time. MMSE is widely used in epidemiological studies and forms a part of the Dysostotic Interview Schedule (DIS) and epidemiologic catchment Area (ECA). MMSE depends on multiple cognitive domains, including repetition and verbal recall. Attention, calculation language, and visual construction. It consists of various questions with a minimum score of zero and a maximum score of 30 (appendix A shows the content of MMSE questions). These questions, grouped into seven categories, represent different categories. Each category takes a score from 1 to 8. Table\n2\nshows the distribution of each category with its degree. MMSE was developed to identify people at risk of developing AD, PD, and other forms of dementia. Unless the accepted results were reported using MMSE in some cases, different physicians reported that MMSE is not an accepted tool for MCI evaluation; patients with cognitive impairment perform in the normal range on the MMSE. Therefore, a tool to evaluate MCI. To address this problem, MoCA was developed as a screening tool for patients with mild cognitive complaints.\n2. 2.\nMoCA:\nMoCA is a screening test developed to detect impairment domains commonly occurring in MCI. It is used to evaluate people with symptoms of cognitive decline, such as memory loss, language loss, etc. The initial version of MoCA covered ten domains using an easy and rapid cognitive task.

The prevalence of AD increases exponentially with age, ranging from 1% among people between 60 and 64 years to 38% among individuals over 85 years\n26\n. Similarly, PD is more prevalent in older individuals. Consequently, there is a growing need to understand the progression of these diseases and develop early identification methods\n27\n,\n28\n.\nPatients with MCI exhibit memory impairment that exceeds what would be expected for their age, but they do not meet the criteria for a diagnosis of AD\n28\n. However, individuals with MCI are at a higher risk of developing AD and PD, making early detection crucial\n29\n,\n30\n. Research indicates that the conversion rate from MCI to AD is approximately 15% per year, while the conversion rate from MCI to PD is approximately 12.8%\n29\n,\n30\n. To address the need for early identification and prediction of disease progression, recent research has focused on predicting cognitive function decline and the risk of developing AD and PD. By combining these predictive models, researchers aim to provide valuable insights into disease trajectories and enable timely interventions.\nAdvancements in data analysis and ML techniques have facilitated the development of predictive models for cognitive decline and disease progression. These models utilize various data sources, including medical records, cognitive assessments, genetic information, and biomarkers, to identify patterns and indicators of disease progression. Recent studies have shown promising results in predicting the progression of cognitive function.

These operations will be discussed in detail in the following subsections.\n1. 1.\nOutlier Detection\n: Outlier detection involves the identification of exceptional values within a dataset in relation to normal values. Recognizing outliers is a crucial step in data preparation as it significantly impacts the performance of classification and clustering algorithms. Various statistical techniques, such as proximity-based models and distance-based methods, address the outlier problem. However, in this investigation, we rely on the expertise of our medical professionals to identify and resolve data outliers.\n2. 2.\nMICE\n: For handling missing values, we employ the Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) method implemented in R. Missing values can arise due to corruption or data collection errors, and their presence can adversely affect classifier performance, leading to bias effects. Basic methods, such as mean, maximum, and minimum, are commonly used for inputting numeric values, while the most frequently occurring item is employed for categorical values. In our study, we observe a small number of missing values in each column, ranging from 2 to 5 for each column. To ensure high accuracy in the imputed data, we adopt the MICE method, which generates n complete datasets by replacing missing variables with n distinct values. These datasets are then analyzed, pooled, and combined to create a resultant dataset.

This prevents the Classifier from exhibiting bias towards a particular class, reducing uncertainty and minimizing the likelihood of inaccurate findings or increased cost/processing time.

By studying various neurological conditions that impact specific brain regions, it is possible to identify symptoms such as aphasia, forgetfulness, agnosia, and apraxia as indicative of cortical dementia, which includes AD and frontotemporal dementia. On the other hand, subcortical dementias encompass Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Binswanger's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, multiple sclerosis, and Sydenham's chorea. However, certain diseases, such as corticobasal degeneration, multiple system atrophy, vascular dementia, and HIV dementia, affect both cortical and subcortical regions of the brain, resulting in a complex manifestation of dementia\n62\n,\n63\n.\nThe novelty of the hybrid test is to introduce a set of features combination that allows healthcare providers to evaluate cognitive progression and differentiate between cortical and subcortical diseases, for instance:", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/277", "#/texts/279", "#/texts/280", "#/texts/281", "#/texts/282", "#/texts/283", "#/texts/284", "#/texts/285"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "f6ffec0d-9734-422c-be8d-30516932a31d"}

However, encoding and storage, which are severely compromised in cortical-type diseases, are mostly unaffected. Subcortical abnormalities also result in a deficiency in spontaneous recall.\n2. 2.\nLanguage evaluation\n: This is attributed to the fact that cortical forms of dementia are more likely to exhibit linguistic impairments. Patients with AD experience progressive language impairments that begin with anomia and advance to transcortical sensory aphasia, eventually leading to a terminal language syndrome characterized by echolalia, logoclonia, and palilalia, resulting in a complex dementia profile\n31\n. Aphasia manifests early in cortical dementias, such as AD, whereas specific aphasia syndromes have not been delineated in subcortical dementias.\n3. 3. Executive functions involve the prefrontal lobes and associated subcortical structures. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect impairments in executive functions in both subcortical and cortical dementias.\n4. 4.\nVisuospatial function\n: Visuospatial deficits are prominent in cortical and subcortical dementias. Although it is challenging to quantify and distinguish cognitive processing slowdown from motor retardation accurately, bradyphrenia appears to be more prevalent in subcortical dementia syndromes than in cortical types\n63\n. Additionally, 10 tests were employed covering various abilities such as attention, writing, and reading. Table\n10\nprovides an overview of all the score tests, including the hybrid test.

This degeneration leads to neuronal degeneration and severe brain atrophy. Clinical manifestations commonly observed in AD include dyscalculia, dysphasia, and dyspraxia. On the other hand, subcortical dementia syndromes encompass various conditions such as degenerative extrapyramidal syndromes, subcortical infarctions, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), multiple sclerosis, thalamic degenerative disorders, subcortical trauma, inflammatory processes, and tumors. Lesions in subcortical dementias mainly occur in the basal ganglia, select brainstem nuclei, and the cerebellum\n64\n. The atrophy of the caudate nucleus, due to its close connections with the prefrontal cortex, can disrupt the caudate-prefrontal loops and lead to neuropsychological alterations in patients without apparent prefrontal lesions. Cognitive impairment in such patients has been strongly associated with the severity of motor symptoms rather than the duration of the disease\n65\n.\nProcedural learning in PD and Huntington's dementia has been extensively studied.

This improvement returns to a couple of reasons, including (i) combining several models results in a more flexible, robust, and precise model, (ii) integration contributes to developing a less biased and more precise model, and (iii) using random subspace and bagging contributes to preventing overfitting.\nIn DMMLP, the base layer deals with heterogeneous events and the selected proper attributes.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/301", "#/texts/302"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "60eae7e8-ca21-4267-b61f-274c17ec47d5"}

Standard metrics measure network throughput, bandwidth, latency, jitter, and packet loss. The size of the network is between 100 and 500 sensor nodes. The connection between these nodes was made using IEEE 802.11p/WAVE. The configuration of the IEEE 802.11 protocol is described in Table\n12\n, according to the Fog Hierarchical Deployment Model from OpenFog Reference Architecture\n65\n.

The percentage of packet loss can be expressed as follows\n72\n:\n$$Packt \\,loss\\%= \\frac{transmitted\\, packets\\,-\\,recieved\\, packets}{transmitted\\, packets}$$\nA comparison of the proposed framework-based fog technology and the existing cloud system\n73\nwas conducted to test the performance of the proposed architecture in terms of packet loss reduction. As Fig.\n5\na shows, a significant difference between fog technology and cloud computing is diminishing the number of lost packets across the network. This effect emerged because fog technology's local data processing feature is crucial in decreasing the need to use network bandwidth continuously. Therefore, there is no network congestion, so the likelihood of losing data and the need to send it frequently is minimal. For more clarification, Fig.\n5\nb shows the difference between fog technology and the existing cloud system (Table\n12\n).\nFig. 5\n(2) Network throughput:\nThis metric indicates the quality of the network bandwidth or the link quality that is usually used to evaluate the amount of network connection and transmission reliability. The total network throughput refers to the average of successful packet delivery across network channels, and it can be measured as follows\n72\n:\n$$Total \\,throughput= \\frac{delivered\\, packets\\,*\\,size\\, of\\, packet}{simulation\\, time}$$\nFigure\n6\na shows that the proposed framework-based fog technology was compared with the existing cloud system\n73\nto measure its effectiveness in network throughput. The concept of throughput is usually related to both the link quality and the percentage of packet loss. This effect explains that packet loss directly reduces throughput, as some protocols used in the transport layer interpret loss as an indication of link congestion. Thus, their transmission rate must be adjusted to avert congestive network collapse. This describes the proposed framework's outperformance over the cloud system. The proposed framework maintains its performance by reducing bandwidth consumption due to its ability to deal with packet requests locally without uploading them to the cloud server. For more clarification, Fig.\n6\nb depicts the percentage difference between the two systems.\nFig. 6", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/334", "#/texts/335", "#/texts/336", "#/texts/337", "#/texts/338", "#/texts/339", "#/texts/340", "#/texts/341", "#/texts/342", "#/texts/343", "#/texts/344", "#/texts/345", "#/texts/346", "#/texts/347", "#/texts/348", "#/texts/349", "#/texts/350", "#/texts/351", "#/texts/352", "#/texts/353", "#/texts/354", "#/texts/355", "#/texts/356", "#/texts/357", "#/texts/358", "#/texts/359", "#/texts/360", "#/texts/361"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "b47b07f8-0c9d-4d35-808e-fb6a41c55867"}

The steps for assessing the proposed screening test can be summarized as follows: (i) all patients were examined generally to follow up on their cognitive abilities, (ii) patients underwent routine lab and conventional MRI to exclude any other cause of dementia other than Alzheimer's or Parkinson's diseases, and (iii)to compare the performance of the proposed screening test with the MoCA and MMSE examination test, all patients were examined with MMNE, MOCA Arabic version, in addition to our proposed test. Results of all examination tests were recorded to provide a fair comparison according to the Patient's score. Table\n17\nshows the patient distribution according to their scores in each examination test. Tables\n18\nand\n19\ncompare the proposed test, MMSE, and MoCA regarding corrected and uncorrected classified samples.\nThe results demonstrate the proposed hybrid's ability to provide high accuracy of diagnosis and early diagnosis of MCI to manage the case as early as possible and delay dementia whenever possible.\n\nDeveloping an explainable machine learning and fog computing-based visual rating scale for the prediction of dementia progression\nDiscussion\nThe correct proposed test provides higher accuracy in detecting MCI than the correct MMSE or MOCA. As the proposed test includes more objective domains than the other two tests, it can measure cortical areas' domains, e.g., speech, apraxia, abstraction, and delayed memory testing, which also detect subcortical domains like visuospatial and executive function.

Several mental cognitive tests are used to check the progression of a patient's cognitive functioning. The MoCA test checks language, visual, spatial thinking, orientation, reasoning, and Memory. Such a scoring system could quickly help determine when someone is at risk of developing Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. In this study, a reliable context-aware health monitoring framework based on fog computing to assess mental impairment in the elderly is introduced. This proposed framework provided a remote diagnosis of dementia diseases using fog computing technology and IoT devices. Fog computing receives sensing data from mobile applications or websites, generating real-time warning alerts based on practical data analysis.\nIn the proposed framework, the data were aggregated from 450 patients, 150 patients already clinically diagnosed with Alzheimer's, 150 patients diagnosed with PD dementia, and another 150 patients with MCI (neither demented nor normal). All patients were examined cognitively by both MMSE and MOCA in the Arabic version. The aggregated dataset was utilized to make the following: (i) test the efficiency of both MMSE and MOCA scores, (ii) determine the main domains of cognition that are affected in each group, (iii) use ML for building model that could make an early diagnosis of PK and Alzheimer among MCI patients to manage the case as early as possible and prevent dementia, and (iv) providing a novel cognitive test that could quickly and accurately predict cortical and subcortical diseases. Results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed test over other tests like MoCA and MMSE. Such applications assist clinicians in providing accurate prognoses and personalized treatment, in addition to increasing patients' quality of life.\n\nDeveloping an explainable machine learning and fog computing-based visual rating scale for the prediction of dementia progression\nData availability\nRaw data for dataset D1 are not publicly available to preserve individuals' privacy and coud be accessed upon formal request .
