Neurologists are increasingly assessing ex-contact sports athletes with cognitive and behavioural issues following repetitive head impacts and traumatic brain injury. Their assessment and management can be challenging due to the broad differential diagnosis, including psychiatric issues, trauma-related impairment and, in some cases, neurodegeneration. There may be a range of pathologies present after trauma exposure, including Alzheimer's disease and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Currently, we have only limited understanding of specific clinical phenotypes for distinct types of post-traumatic dementia, nor are there in vivo tests for many of the pathologies. Informed by our experience running a midlife brain health clinic for retired elite contact sport athletes, we describe a practical framework for the workup of athletes with cognitive concerns, highlighting key clinical features, an approach to investigation including neuroimaging and advanced fluid biomarkers, symptomatic management strategies and research directions.\n- TRAUMA, PSYCHOL SEQUE\n- HEAD INJURY\n- DEMENTIA\n- CLINICAL NEUROLOGY\n\nRetired contact sports athletes with cognitive concerns: promoting lifelong brain health | Practical Neurology\nData availability statement\nNo data are available.\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\nThis is an open access article distributed in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 Unported (CC BY 4.0) license, which permits others to copy, redistribute, remix, transform and build upon this work for any purpose, provided the original work is properly cited, a link to the licence is given, and indication of whether changes were made.

Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a trauma-specific tauopathy,\n1\nhas been reported in high-profile brain bank case series of American footballers.\n2\nCTE has also been reported in smaller post-mortem series including former soccer and rugby players.\n3\nSeveral rugby players in the UK have been diagnosed with young onset dementia during life, which has been attributed to CTE, and an associated class action legal claim is underway.\nAn important task for the neurologist in this setting is to disentangle the direct effects of TBI, which may be lifelong and fluctuating, from the effects of progressive neurodegeneration that could produce dementia and from important mimics such as mood disorders and/or functional cognitive disorder. While TBI is associated with a higher risk of progressive problems, the presence of TBI is not synonymous with the presence of a progressive neurodegenerative disease.\nTBI affects around 50-60\u2009million people each year,\n4\nand moderate to severe injuries in particular are a common cause of long-term disability. Patients commonly attend neurology clinics with long-term consequences that are difficult to assess clinically.\n5\nThe cognitive, psychiatric and functional consequences of TBI are highly variable. Most people make a complete recovery after mild TBI, yet a significant subset may experience slow-to-resolve or persistent symptoms. For example, a recent analysis of the CENTRE-TBI cohort found incomplete recovery in 47% of patients with mild TBI at 6 months. Post-injury trajectories may be highly dynamic, with a subset of patients showing clinical decline years after injury.\n6 7\nInterestingly, this is not limited to severe TBI: in the large TRACK-TBI LONG study (n&gt;2000), chronic functional decline occurred in 29% of people after mild TBI, and 26% of those with moderate to severe TBI over the first 7 years.\n8\nThe causes of these long-term problems are complex, with post-injury symptoms often at the interface of neurology and psychiatry.\n9 10", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/81", "#/texts/82", "#/texts/83", "#/texts/84", "#/texts/85", "#/texts/86", "#/texts/87", "#/texts/88", "#/texts/89", "#/texts/90", "#/texts/91", "#/texts/92", "#/texts/93", "#/texts/94", "#/texts/95", "#/texts/96", "#/texts/97", "#/texts/98"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "8a0fcbb7-7e52-4f9a-bb13-00156b9185b6"}

In a midlife setting, these tend to be noticed by the patient and are less evident to family members or work colleagues. Impaired functioning in activities of daily living is relatively uncommon.\n24\nCognitive symptoms were common in our series of midlife rugby players, but no individual met the functional impairment criteria for dementia.\n25\nOther common complaints include concerns about behaviour, particularly irritability or aggression, affective symptoms (anxiety &gt;low\u2009mood) and headache. More rarely, patients complain of neurological symptoms such as dizziness or motor dysfunction. Family members often complain of behavioural issues, which may be associated with relationship difficulties. A relatively distinctive complaint is of memory impairments related to sporting fixtures in which the former player participated. This can occur in the absence of difficulties recalling recent events. If the patient sustained a TBI during the game, a period of post-traumatic amnesia may explain the lack of memory. More commonly, there is no clear history of TBI during the match, and it is unclear whether the lack of memory is abnormal. Many people are concerned that the inability to recall prior match fixtures indicates neurodegenerative dementia, yet there are several important differential diagnoses, including functional cognitive disorder\n26\n(other differentials such as transient epileptic amnesia are far less likely and are associated with other distinctive clinical features).", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/130", "#/texts/131", "#/texts/132", "#/texts/133", "#/texts/134", "#/texts/135", "#/texts/136", "#/texts/137", "#/texts/139", "#/texts/140", "#/texts/141", "#/texts/142", "#/texts/143", "#/texts/144", "#/texts/145"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "b4fdcc18-a32d-4e14-b59d-29c30bec3cc0"}

Historically, there have been attempts to define a syndrome of progressive and disabling cognitive and motor impairments associated with repetitive head impacts. This was first described in the late 1920s in Martland's report of 'punch-drunk' boxers,\n27\nand later refined by Critchley who termed this 'chronic progressive traumatic encephalopathy'.\n28 29\nMore recent descriptions based on post-mortem findings in American footballers emphasised neuropsychiatric symptoms such as irritability and violent outbursts, with or without cognitive impairment, in an entity called 'traumatic encephalopathy syndrome', conceptualised to correspond to CTE.\n25 30\nUnfortunately, the traumatic encephalopathy syndrome\nresearch\ndiagnostic criteria are not yet ready for use in clinical practice, being formulated across several US brain bank case series reflecting predominantly American football exposures, with uncertain sensitivity/specificity in other sports.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/146", "#/texts/147", "#/texts/148", "#/texts/149", "#/texts/150", "#/texts/151", "#/texts/152", "#/texts/153", "#/texts/154"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "ad7f8d8c-74f4-4697-8ab2-f1b29b27c951"}

In a post-mortem series of former boxers with dementia, he described neurofibrillary tangles in a distribution distinct from AD, with a relative absence of senile plaques (ie, A\u03b2). More recently, Ann McKee described CTE pathology in American footballers,\n32\nwhere intraneuronal (predominantly 3-repeat) tau pathology has a characteristic distribution around blood vessels particularly in the cortical sulcal depths (see\nfigure 1\n)\n33\nwith 4-repeat tau also seen predominantly in astrocytes.\n34 35\nModern analyses of the Corsellis collection at Imperial College London, have confirmed the presence of CTE in a substantial proportion of cases using modern pathological diagnostic criteria.\n36\nElectron microscopy has recently shown the structure of paired helical filaments in CTE tau to be distinct from AD.\n31\nIntriguingly, it is identical to that of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, a progressive cognitive impairment seen occasionally after measles virus exposure, as well as the ALS/Parkinson's dementia complex and vacuolar dementia (\nfigure 1\n).\n37 38\n- Download figure\n- Open in new tab\n- Download powerpoint\nFigure 1", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/156", "#/texts/157", "#/texts/158", "#/texts/159", "#/texts/160", "#/texts/161", "#/texts/162", "#/texts/163", "#/texts/164", "#/texts/165", "#/texts/166", "#/texts/167", "#/texts/168", "#/texts/169", "#/texts/170", "#/texts/171", "#/texts/172", "#/texts/173", "#/texts/174", "#/texts/175", "#/texts/176", "#/texts/177"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "dc823baf-0d72-4301-a2f5-53e2efa150af"}

For example, we often ask retired players about details of recent matches they have watched, which can be very discriminating as an objective measure of memory impairment. Symptoms of dysfunction in other domains such as language, calculation, praxis and visuospatial function should be evaluated.

These may occur in isolation from cognitive impairment and are described as a 'core feature' of traumatic encephalopathy syndrome, with some association with frontal CTE pathology.\n43\nAffective problems, particularly depression and anxiety symptoms, are common and can contribute to neurological complaints. We use standardised questionnaires (Beck Depression Inventory 2nd Edition - BDI-II and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale - HADS) to screen for clinically relevant symptoms, but patients often need psychiatric assessment to clarify the diagnosis. Psychosis is uncommon, except in the context of post-traumatic amnesia (acutely after injury), in advanced neurodegenerative disease or in the presence of drug abuse. Post-traumatic stress disorder is also uncommon after repeated head impact exposure in a sporting context, but may be more common in military settings,\n44\nparticularly when memory for the index injury is retained. Psychiatric problems that pre-date TBI are a vulnerability factor for poor outcomes,\n45\nand the presence of a pre-existing mental health condition makes it more likely that patients will develop a psychiatric disorder after head injury.\n46\nIt is useful to enquire about symptoms relevant to key differential diagnoses, particularly behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, such as obsessionality, new fixed rituals, loss of empathy or social awareness (eg, inappropriate humour, sexual disinhibition), gambling and changes in dietary preference (eg, developing a sweet tooth). A dedicated neuropsychiatric assessment may help, particularly where symptoms are causing problems for patients and/or family members.

The risk of late problems appears to relate to cumulative head trauma load.\n42\nPlayers usually present after many years of exposure, so a precise individual estimate of exposure is not possible. However, the duration of playing career, type of involvement (professional, amateur and/or youth), the positions played and the number of concussions sustained provide useful proxies for the cumulative exposure. For American football participation, more precise estimates of head impact exposures for specific player positions have been generated in the research setting,\n42\nbut these are not available for sports commonly played in the UK. In the future, much more information about cumulative head impact exposure will be available for some players: most professional rugby players in the UK now wear instrumented mouth guards.\n47\nHence, in the future, some players will present to clinic with precise information about their cumulative exposure, which may prove useful in evaluating long-term risk.\nThe assessment and management of concussion has been an important focus of sports medicine and sporting governing bodies in recent years.\n48 49\nAs we have previously argued,\n10\nusing concussion as a diagnosis or as the focus for clinical management is problematic because the heterogeneous symptoms that comprise concussion or post-concussion syndrome have varying pathophysiology. However, players are almost always familiar with the term and can provide information about symptomatic head impacts during their careers that they may have considered concussions, although there is a wide variability in the way concussions are reported retrospectively. Our pragmatic approach is to document the number of concussions a player reports using standardised tools such as the Mayo classification of TBI\n50\n(see\ntable 2\nfor clinical and imaging features which define different severity/confidence levels), but we avoid using concussion or post-concussion syndrome as diagnostic labels. For symptomatic head impacts, loss of consciousness, retrograde or post-traumatic amnesia duration, hospitalisation, imaging findings and recovery time (including return-to-play protocols) should be documented. We recommend using the widely used Mayo classification of TBI severity,\n49\nwhich incorporates clinical features such as the Glasgow coma scale and post-traumatic amnesia duration, but also makes use of neuroimaging findings, classifying each injury as symptomatic possible, mild probable, moderate-severe\n50\n(\ntable 2\n).\nView this table:", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/217", "#/texts/218", "#/texts/219", "#/texts/220", "#/texts/221", "#/texts/222", "#/texts/223", "#/texts/224", "#/texts/225", "#/texts/226", "#/texts/227", "#/texts/228", "#/texts/229", "#/texts/230", "#/texts/231", "#/texts/232", "#/texts/233", "#/texts/234", "#/texts/235", "#/texts/236", "#/texts/237", "#/texts/238", "#/texts/239"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "003daee8-21df-4736-a669-816674704506"}

A cautious approach is merited in attributing the symptoms to repetitive head impacts, TBI or neurodegeneration, particularly given the prognostic implications of such a diagnosis. The neurologist needs to consider the strong priors for non-neurodegenerative explanations of many symptoms in young adults, while recognising that neurodegenerative disease rates increase markedly with age.\nPatients with significant concerns are best assessed in a multidisciplinary clinic, ideally with input from neurology, neuropsychiatry and neuropsychology. Consensus assessment is helpful given the prominent mixtures of cognitive, neurological and psychiatric symptomatology. Initial lighter touch screening of patients with concerns about brain health given a history of head impact exposure is a pragmatic approach to dealing with large patient numbers and avoids unnecessary investigations.\nWe avoid using the term traumatic encephalopathy syndrome in routine clinical diagnosis as it is an unvalidated research construct, with uncertain accuracy especially outside American football players. People often ask directly if their symptoms are due to their sporting career. It is important to acknowledge that head trauma exposure is a dementia risk factor, but attributing an individual's symptoms definitively to repetitive head impacts is often challenging due to the multifactorial nature of dementia and current diagnostic limitations. Explaining this uncertainty is key. For individuals still actively exposed to repetitive head impacts, counselling about the risks of continuing should involve a discussion of these uncertainties, consideration of any existing clinical impairment or imaging abnormalities and shared decision-making regarding strategies to minimise further exposure versus personal preferences.

Conditions such as depression, anxiety and sleep disorders are common and can significantly impact cognition. Targeted investigation and treatment, including psychological therapies and psychiatric medications, are often beneficial and should be prioritised, particularly in those with subjective complaints but no clear neurodegenerative process. Neurobehavioural dysregulation symptoms such as irritability and agitation may respond to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in the first instance, or low-dose atypical anti-psychotics such as risperidone should these prove ineffective.\nIn people with dementia and evidence of Alzheimer's pathology, if there is no contraindication, our practice is to use cholinesterase inhibitors (eg, donepezil, galantamine or rivastigmine), or a N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist such as memantine. However, there is no specific evidence to support this in the setting of cognitive impairment following repetitive head impacts thought to be due to CTE without Alzheimer's pathology. In contrast to TBI, where stimulants such as lisdexamfetamine and methylphenidate\n76\nmay be helpful off-label for attentional problems, there is no evidence to support their use after repetitive head impacts.\nClinicians should take the opportunity to provide individualised advice for maintaining life-long brain health. This involves optimising vascular risk factors (blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes control), encouraging physical activity and socialisation and addressing other factors such as sensory impairment.\n77\nReferral to community memory services is important for ongoing support in people who have progressive problems, particularly for the management of behavioural and psychiatric symptoms.

DJS and RJS participate in an expert panel advising the English RFU on concussion and related issues. DJS has received an honorarium from the RFU for his participation, which has been used for research purposes. RJS acts as an independent concussion expert for World Rugby and receives payment for providing independent clinical care for professional players following head injuries. DJS and RS have received complementary tickets to international rugby matches paid for by the Rugby Football Union. ISEH invoices the Rugby Football Union for the number of former players seen in clinic per quarter. In turn, DJS, RS, DF and MP receive pass through payment from ISEH for the provision of private clinical services. ISEH receives funding from the RFU and FA to employ NG, EJR and YL for the provision of research services. Clinical assessment of older players has been supported by the PFA.
