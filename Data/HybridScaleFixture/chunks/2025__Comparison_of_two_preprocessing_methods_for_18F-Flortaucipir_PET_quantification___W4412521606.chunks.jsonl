Positron emission tomography (PET) serves a pivotal tool for the in vivo visualisation and quantification of AD pathology [\n2\n], with tau-PET measuring tau pathological changes [\n3\n] that have been strongly associated with cognitive impairment and decline in AD. Tau-PET outperformed other AD biomarkers in predicting cognitive worsening [\n4\n,\n5\n,\n6\n], overall supporting its relevance as a biomarker for disease staging and prognosis [\n4\n,\n7\n,\n8\n].\nDespite the emerging relevance of tau-PET imaging, no consensus exists on a reference pipeline for the quantification of tau-PET. Variability in PET quantification arises from multiple methodological factors, including different tracers, choice of target/reference regions, native vs standard space processing or selection of different brain atlases [\n9\n,\n10\n]. The reference region selection depends on the radiotracer used [\n11\n]. For most tau tracers, cerebellar grey matter is chosen [\n12\n], using frequently the inferior cerebellar grey matter or the cerebellar crus.\nThe reference space selection has been demonstrated to have impact on quantification with amyloid-PET where native space processing can improve the accuracy of standardized uptake value ratios (SUVR) [\n13\n], but this has never been explored for tau-PET using\n18\nF-flortaucipir neither with any other tracer. In standard space processing tau-PET images were spatially normalized to a common template, in many cases the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template, whereas, in native space processing images are analysed in the individual subject's anatomical space. Standard space processing facilitates voxel-wise analysis, whereas native space preserves anatomical information, and it is recommended in volumetric measurements [\n14\n]. Since native space method may require more computational resources and longer preprocessing times [\n13\n,\n14\n], standard space method could be a viable alternative when MRI is unavailable or to reduce the time required for processing [\n15\n].", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/80", "#/texts/81", "#/texts/82", "#/texts/83", "#/texts/84", "#/texts/85", "#/texts/86", "#/texts/87", "#/texts/88", "#/texts/89", "#/texts/90", "#/texts/91", "#/texts/92", "#/texts/93", "#/texts/94", "#/texts/95", "#/texts/96", "#/texts/97", "#/texts/98", "#/texts/99", "#/texts/100", "#/texts/101", "#/texts/102", "#/texts/103", "#/texts/104", "#/texts/105", "#/texts/106", "#/texts/107", "#/texts/108", "#/texts/109", "#/texts/110", "#/texts/111", "#/texts/112", "#/texts/113", "#/texts/114", "#/texts/115", "#/texts/116", "#/texts/117", "#/texts/118", "#/texts/119", "#/texts/120"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "6d50d46f-03d9-4205-a9cf-25f79ccb0a77"}

The pipeline in the native space processing is commonly used in research [\n16\n,\n17\n], while most of clinical research series are processed in standard space [\n4\n,\n18\n,\n19\n].

When discriminating decliner and stable individuals, SUVR in the MTL obtained with native space processing method outperformed the one obtained with standard space method (\np\n=\u20090.04) (Table\n3\n).\nSimilar results were demonstrated when analyzing a subgroup of scans acquired with the Biograph mCT scanner (Table\nS1\n), showing significantly higher discriminative power of native space processing over standard space in classifying tau positive and tau negative cases. High discriminative power were found for both methods in distinguishing A\u2009+\u2009CI from A-CU, with no significant difference between the two methods. In discriminating decliners and non-decliners there was no significant difference between the two processing methods (Table\nS1\n). For scans acquired using the machine with higher sensitivity and resolution, namely Biograph Vision 600 Edge, there was no significant difference between native and standard processing methods in discriminating visual tau status, A\u2009+\u2009CI/A-CU status, and declining status (Table\nS2\n).\nWhen we compared SUVR obtained with the standard space processing methods with two different reference regions, we found strong correlations between two approaches (Figure\nS1\n) and only marginal differences in discriminating patients in AD continuum (Table\nS3\n). In particular SUVR obtained using the cerebellar crus as reference region were able to better discriminate tau visual status only in MTL and Braak I. In contrast, inferior cerebellum grey matter was superior in discriminating A\u2009+\u2009CI from A-CU in early AD meta-ROI (Table\nS3\n).

We aimed to assess whether native and standard space methods produce similar results, as the standard space method represents a faster method applicable also when MRI data is absent. The two approaches demonstrated strong and significant correlations in all considered AD-related regions and a similar capacity in differentiating AD patients from non-AD patients. Although two pipelines could capture similar overall tau deposition patterns in AD, some differences emerged favouring the native preprocessing being similar to visual reading and more accurate in quantifying tau in the regions representing the earliest disease stages.\nThe SUVR obtained from both preprocessing methods showed strong correlations across all regions, indicating a high consistency in quantifying tau and supporting robustness of both methods for detecting overall tau pathology. Our findings indicate increase in tau-positive cases in both methods along the AD spectrum, with SUVR progressively increased from A-CU to A\u2009+\u2009CI individuals, reflecting a well-established link between tau accumulation and clinical symptoms, regardless of the reference space selected in the processing pipeline, further supporting the value of tau-PET as staging marker in AD [\n25\n].

Specifically, both methods demonstrated strong discriminative performance between tau status as assessed visually across all regions presenting high AUC (&gt;\u20090.7); however, the native space method showed superior discriminative power with significantly greater values in all the regions. Previous research suggested high accuracy of tau visual assessment in identification of tau pathological change and validation of the results with postmortem information [\n26\n]. In MCI and AD, visually assessed tau positivity was associated with an increased risk of future cognitive decline [\n25\n]. Despite both preprocessing methods showing a very good performance in discriminating tau status, the native space preprocessing performed significantly better. In line with that, SUVR in MTL obtained with native space method performed better in discriminating cognitively declining participants from stable individuals compared to the standard space method. MTL is known to be the earliest site of tau accumulation making the native space method potentially more sensitive to subtle, early-stage tau pathology [\n2\n]. The native space approach may more accurately capture atrophy in small structures such as the entorhinal cortex. Using native space processing can improve the accuracy of regional quantification by preserving subject specific details and thus it can enhance sensitivity and reliability in both research and clinical settings. The highest added value resides in the identification of tau accumulation in the earliest stages. Analysing tau in the hippocampus and in MTL using\n18\nF-flortaucipir PET poses a challenge due to off-target binding in the nearby choroid plexus. The choroid plexus signal occurs in the absence of tau and it likely has other causes such as iron deposition, melanin, and mineralization [\n27\n,\n28\n]. In semi-quantification, adjusting for off-target binding can be difficult. Native space method may offer greater accuracy in discrimination of true binding and off-target signal since the ROI segmentation can be more precise compared to standard space. We found that the standard space method tends to overestimate SUVR likely due to the inclusion of off-target binding [\n10\n,\n29", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/279", "#/texts/280", "#/texts/281", "#/texts/282", "#/texts/283", "#/texts/284", "#/texts/285", "#/texts/286", "#/texts/287", "#/texts/288", "#/texts/289", "#/texts/290", "#/texts/291", "#/texts/292", "#/texts/293", "#/texts/294"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "548d2f85-aefe-4079-b833-5fffd253f6cc"}

The higher resolution and sensitivity of the Biograph Vision 600 Edge scanner enhances imaging accuracy and thus reduces the performance gap between the native and standard space processing, making both methods comparable even for quantification in small regions such as MTL.\nAlthough the primary focus of our paper was on how different reference spaces can influence tau quantification, we are aware that the cerebellar crus is frequently used as a reference region for tau in standard space preprocessing [\n25\n]. Therefore, we examined this method in parallel to assess how it might differ between using cerebellar crus and inferior cerebellar grey matter as reference region in quantification of tau.
