Genetic testing, imaging and fluid biomarkers mean that levels of risk of dementia diagnosis are becoming frequent and complex. How risk is communicated in this context is an increasingly important topic.\nAims\nThe aim of this scoping review is to map the existing literature regarding the components of risk communication, the factors influencing its outcomes and the guidelines developed to support clinicians in this process.\nMethods\nThis is a systematic scoping review addressing the communication of risk to individuals living with or at risk of dementia, as well as perspectives of family, carers and healthcare professionals.\nResults\n115 articles were identified, including genetic (n=41), amyloid (n=45) and other biomarkers (n=9). Patients expressed a desire to be informed about their risk of developing dementia, listing future planning and participation in clinical research as benefits of disclosure. While risk disclosure did not significantly impact anxiety or depression, it was associated with increased event distress among participants identified as elevated risk. Individuals at high risk frequently overestimated their likelihood of developing dementia. Tools and guidelines that have supported clinicians in risk disclosure emphasised the use of educational materials, clear communication about risk and prognosis, and regular follow-up appointments. Gaps in literature include blood biomarkers, non-Alzheimer's disease dementias and communication to people with cognitive impairment.\nConclusions\nRisk communication is a crucial topic for healthcare professionals, especially since the emergence of novel techniques to predict dementia.\nBack to top", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/1", "#/texts/2", "#/texts/3", "#/texts/4", "#/texts/5", "#/texts/6", "#/texts/7", "#/texts/8", "#/texts/9", "#/texts/10", "#/texts/11", "#/texts/12", "#/texts/13", "#/texts/14", "#/texts/15", "#/texts/17", "#/texts/18", "#/texts/19", "#/texts/20", "#/texts/21", "#/texts/22", "#/texts/23", "#/texts/24", "#/texts/25", "#/texts/26", "#/texts/27", "#/texts/28", "#/texts/29", "#/texts/30", "#/texts/31", "#/texts/32", "#/texts/33", "#/texts/34", "#/texts/35", "#/texts/36", "#/texts/37", "#/texts/38", "#/texts/39", "#/texts/41", "#/texts/42", "#/texts/43", "#/texts/44", "#/texts/45", "#/texts/46", "#/texts/47", "#/texts/48", "#/texts/49", "#/texts/50", "#/texts/51"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "9cb0611f-5a53-452b-a3cb-c482c6f8d686"}

Risk communication is crucial as it informs individuals of the challenges they may face and empowers individuals to make informed choices regarding their future. Conveying complex numerical or statistical information can be challenging to all patients but can prove to be especially difficult to those suffering from dementia, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or other cognitive deficits.\n3 4\nTherefore, understanding how to easily and accessibly deliver risk information is important to all healthcare professionals.\nThere has been significant progress in the field of dementia research, including the identification of genes which are associated with a higher risk of disease and imaging and fluid biomarkers of pathology.\n5 6\nSome of the most commonly known risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD) include\napolipoprotein E\n\u03b54 (\nAPOE\n\u03b54) and build-up of amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) plaques or neurofibrillary tangles in the brain.\n7 8\nOther genetic factors which cause familial AD are mutations in the\namyloid precursor protein\n(\nAPP\n) gene,\npresenilin 1\n(\nPSEN1\n) gene and the\npresenilin 2\n(\nPSEN2\n) gene.\n9\nAlternatively, structural MRI can be used for detecting brain atrophy prognostic for dementia, and Dopamine Transporter Scan, to support a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease dementia.\n10 11\nMost recently, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood-based biomarkers (BBMs) offer an accessible approach to early detection, with some markers predicting dementia risk up to 15 years before diagnosis.\n12 13\nKey BBMs, including phosphorylated tau (\neg, p-tau217\n), amyloid-beta (\neg, A\u03b240\n), glial fibrillar acidic protein (\nGFAP\n) and neurofilament light are being evaluated as part of a 5-year multisite UK study with hope that these diagnostic and prognostic tools may soon be integrated into routine National Health Service (NHS) dementia clinics.\n14 15", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/59", "#/texts/60", "#/texts/61", "#/texts/62", "#/texts/63", "#/texts/64", "#/texts/65", "#/texts/66", "#/texts/67", "#/texts/68", "#/texts/69", "#/texts/70", "#/texts/71", "#/texts/72", "#/texts/73", "#/texts/74", "#/texts/75", "#/texts/76", "#/texts/77", "#/texts/78", "#/texts/79", "#/texts/80", "#/texts/81", "#/texts/82", "#/texts/83", "#/texts/84", "#/texts/85", "#/texts/86", "#/texts/87", "#/texts/88", "#/texts/89", "#/texts/90", "#/texts/91", "#/texts/92", "#/texts/93", "#/texts/94", "#/texts/95", "#/texts/96", "#/texts/97", "#/texts/98", "#/texts/99"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "6ec79223-458a-496a-bb33-0b5135e168b4"}

A scoping review was chosen to map and summarise evidence on the disclosure of risk in dementia, to identify areas of strength and gaps in the literature. We followed a systematic approach for our methodology, ensuring accurate identification of available sources.\nOur main findings were that risk communication is desired by patients and caregivers but is often not communicated in practice. Participants often feared negative effects of risk disclosure, but there is limited evidence to support this as anxiety and depression remained low among participants. Event distress was higher in participants at elevated risk, but some studies showed this diminishes with time. The reasons behind this discrepancy could be that despite fearfulness of an increased risk, having clarity about one's health condition leads to reduced anxiety. Participants showed high willingness to change health-related behaviour and advanced care plans.\nWe identified several resources to help patient and clinician communication. Participants emphasised the need for clear communication, tailored to individual preferences. This is further supported by analysis of communication in disclosure sessions, revealing patient-centred consultations to have higher levels of satisfaction.\n99 100\nA multimodal approach was recommended to improve comprehension of risk by participants.

Despite the fact that these were randomised controlled trials, providing us with replicable and accurate evidence, relying solely on information from one group limits the generalisability of the results.\nWe have identified an apparent gap of studies in people with dementia and people with non-AD dementia. Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) was specifically discussed in three studies, vascular dementia participants were included in three studies, and progression to dementia from REM sleep disorder only in four.

Most of the patients referred to memory clinics are people with cognitive or behavioural difficulties rather than healthy individuals, yet little research addresses how prognostic information is conveyed to this population. Effective communication of prognosis, such as the risk of emergency psychiatric admission or the development of behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia, is an important but insufficiently addressed aspect of research in dementia. We also found a significant geographic and demographic imbalance. Many of the studies included white participants with research concentrated in high-income, western countries, particularly the USA.\nFurthermore, there was a significant gap in BBM and CSF communication as well as non-AD dementia. Despite identifying studies on amyloid PET imaging, BBMs offer alternative diagnostic possibilities and educating patients on the novel diagnostic utility of CSF and BBMs may also impact interest in disclosure and understanding of results. Additionally, the identified research almost exclusively focuses on AD dementia (77.3%, n=89/115). Limited research focuses on Lewy body and PD dementia, vascular dementia and FTD. This highlights a critical need for more research in risk communication in non-AD dementia.\nThe scoping review highlights the potential for systematic reviews in the areas of risk perception and recall of results. Enough quantitative evidence has come into view to allow for an analysis of whether individuals accurately recall their risk and whether they align with their risk perceptions. Future research should focus on factors that may contribute to inaccurate risk perceptions, which would allow clinicians to focus more on particular subgroups of patients who need more education.\nBack to top\n\nCommunicating the risk of dementia: a scoping review\nConclusions\nThe need for dementia risk communication has become increasingly evident with the advancement of diagnostic modalities and biomarkers. Patients and their caregivers need to be informed of their prognosis, allowing them to have a better understanding of their health.
