AD pathology is characterized by a long-lasting asymptomatic phase, where biomarker abnormalities can occur years, if not decades, prior to symptom onset [\n2\n]. The characterization of this preclinical stage is challenging, partly due to non-specific preclinical findings and debates about their relevance in terms of progression and prognosis [\n3\n]. The preclinical stage is followed by a prodromal stage exhibiting variable risk and rate of progression, ranging from subtle changes in memory and thinking ability to obvious symptoms of brain dysfunction. The heterogeneity of this pre-dementia stage is a well-known phenomenon that has also been extensively studied, with differences in conversion rates to the AD dementia (ADD) stage between the distinctive subtypes (read. single or multi-domain and amnestic or non-amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI)), being of particular interest [\n4\n].", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/105", "#/texts/106", "#/texts/107", "#/texts/108", "#/texts/109", "#/texts/110", "#/texts/111", "#/texts/112", "#/texts/113"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "7169ad0a-ac96-477a-9ee5-babf6c2e5ccb"}

After the hypothetical AD cascade model of Jack et al. [\n9\n,\n10\n], a categorical classification scheme based on biomarker positivity was introduced and recently updated [\n11\n,\n12\n,\n13\n].

The overlap with other types of neurodegenerative diseases, heterogeneity of clinical presentation and pathophysiology of AD, together with the lack of consensus between AD specialists regarding clinical terminology across the AD continuum, has put forward a growing need for an unbiased system for characterizing AD stages. Construction of a model that objectively evaluates the current disease state of a patient, using information that is directly extracted from real-world and subsequently determining the correct sequence of biomarker changes, could facilitate earlier and more accurate diagnosis and give more insight in the dynamics and variability of disease progression, a vital model component considering the heterogeneity of AD [\n21\n].", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/151", "#/texts/152", "#/texts/153", "#/texts/154", "#/texts/155", "#/texts/156", "#/texts/157", "#/texts/158", "#/texts/159", "#/texts/160", "#/texts/161"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "d09ec137-0188-485f-b0a4-d951e54b859b"}

The scope of data driven modelling is to create a holistic image of the entire disease timeline, staging asymptomatic as well as symptomatic patients and enabling identification of potential therapeutic targets. Event-based modeling (EBM) is a promising data-driven approach for establishing the most likely sequence of events in progressive processes such as neurodegenerative brain diseases, including uncertainty in the sequence, with each biomarker event comprising a significant change in patient state [\n22\n,\n24\n]. EBM modeling is based on the principle that more individuals from a cohort containing a disease stage spectrum display data-driven abnormality in biomarkers that change early in disease progression [\n24\n,\n25\n]. It is designed as such that a-priori characterization in different clinical groups is not required. A-priori clinical staging often results in a three-stage division, separating pre-symptomatic, mild cognitive impairment and a dementia stage. It has however been recognized that the concept of cognitive decline in AD is characterized as a long and continuous process, which also applies to the continuous nature of biomarkers measures that already start before clinical manifestations. Regarding the complex, idiopathic and multifactorial nature of AD, meaning there is always a chance that predefined cognitively healthy controls might be preclinical patients, a-priori clinical staging would limit the temporal resolution of the model and would result in a less fine-grained ordering of events [\n26\n,\n27\n].", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/162", "#/texts/163", "#/texts/164", "#/texts/165", "#/texts/166", "#/texts/167", "#/texts/168", "#/texts/169", "#/texts/170", "#/texts/171", "#/texts/172", "#/texts/173", "#/texts/174", "#/texts/175", "#/texts/176", "#/texts/177", "#/texts/178", "#/texts/179", "#/texts/180"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "cecfe775-1fa1-4eb4-8aee-c122b7d2c9f1"}

These tools build disease progression signatures, analyze variability within and between populations, and stage individual patients using diverse medical data (e.g., clinical scores, biofluid biomarkers, and imaging). Without requiring (but acknowledging its importance) an estimate of time to onset, disease duration nor disease stage, a discrete EBM model can construct a clear-cut quantitative disease signature that can significantly improve disease understanding, aid in patient selection in clinical trials and be useful with respect to prognostic methods in routine clinical practice. Despite the existence of continuous disease progression models as a possible alternative [\n28\n,\n29\n,\n30\n], discrete EBM models remain popular in practice due to their simplicity, ability to handle uncertainty and missing data, fewer required parameters, effectiveness with smaller datasets, and alignment with established clinical staging systems [\n31\n].\nEBMs built on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset obtained characteristic biomarker orderings and demonstrated a good ability to classify cognitively normal and AD subjects [\n25\n].

Each EBM stage corresponds to the accumulation of a new biomarker event, therefore, for the selected 9 biomarkers, there are 10 EBM stages (from 0 to 9 respectively). The EBM stage 0 corresponds to no biomarker event having occurred, while stage 9 corresponds to the occurrence of all events. Each biomarker event indicates the change from a 'normal' (read. non-pathological) to an 'abnormal' (read. pathological) event as seen in AD. In addition, since the ADNI training dataset contains CSF biomarkers, while the real-world clinical testing dataset does not, controls who are amyloid positive were identified and relabeled to nonzero (and also not 1). This indicates the model was trained using amyloid-negative controls, to avoid the controls being contaminated by amyloid-positive individuals that might already have AD pathology but do not show any symptoms yet. In this way, the model can be applied to the real-world clinical testing dataset as well.\nOnce the maximum likelihood sequence has been determined using the EBM, the stage for a particular subject is assigned using the highest probability by the model, i.e. the stage, that maximizes the probability of the data given the maximum likelihood event sequence.

This discrepancy suggests variability in the progression patterns of these biomarkers within this cohort, highlighting the complexity of disease dynamics in real-world clinical settings. Despite the uncertainties in biomarker staging, the EBM demonstrated an association between stage progression and clinical diagnosis within the REMEMBER cohort. Specifically, individuals diagnosed with CN and SCD were predominantly categorized in stage 0, indicating no abnormal biomarker events. In contrast, ADD patients were largely distributed across stages 2-5, reflecting the presence of abnormal biomarker changes consistent with disease pathology. MCI subjects showed a more even distribution across EBM stages, with a trend towards higher staging in amnestic MCI cases compared to non-amnestic MCI cases. This association underscores the utility of the EBM in stratifying patients based on disease severity and clinical phenotype, facilitating more targeted interventions and management strategies.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/398"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "e3ff2440-6cc4-4add-9f51-63020a02d90f"}

Several reasons might exist for this observation, including the possibility of subjects being preclinical AD patients, the phenomenon of MCI normalization, the presence of depression or another major psychiatric disorder as a possible cause of cognitive dysfunction and possible progression into other neurodegenerative diseases.\nSubject CN0 was assigned to stage 9 due to abnormal hippocampal, frontal cortex, and parietal cortex volumes. CSF biomarkers were not available for this subject. However, a positive amyloid-PET at baseline, which was not part of the selected biomarkers that were used to create the EBM model, strengthened the hypothesis that the model, even in the case of missing data, classifies accordingly. According to the NIAAA-criteria, in case of absence of CSF biomarkers, the combination of a positive amyloid-PET accompanied by an MRI showing hippocampal atrophy or FDG-PET corresponding with a pathological AD biomarker profile one could suggest that subject CN0 might be a preclinical AD.\nSCD1, who was also classified in stage 4 due to an abnormal P-tau\n181\nvalue and parietal cortex volume, showed a conversion to non-amnestic multi domain MCI during a follow up neuropsychological examination after one year.

In addition, even with the presence of AD-characteristic memory complaints, the possibility to develop into other neurodegenerative diseases is also very much present for the amnestic MCI subjects. For example, aMCI1 revealed an abnormal hippocampal volume, however, was assigned to stage 0. Since follow-up neuropsychological testing indicated a normal cognitive and psychological functioning, it is possible that the underlying pathology might not be AD-related, but due to another disease displaying common pathology (such as early/preclinical hippocampal sclerosis that could not be detected at a neuropsychological evaluation yet). In addition, even though subject aMCI1 had a MMSE score of 30, the neuropsychological examination showed deficits in one cognitive domain: logical memory (&gt;\u20091.5 SD), which could be an indication that the MMSE score might not be sensitive enough.\nThe presence of anxiety, apathy and depression is not uncommon in MCI patients but could also be the cause of their cognitive deficit. For aMCI2, categorized as stage 0, additional FDG-PET testing showed a compatibility with atrophy supported by enlargement of the lateral ventricles, but no indication of an association to AD.

In fact, several longitudinal studies revealed that up to half of the patients diagnosed with MCI during an initial visit to the clinic, returned to normal at follow-up examinations\n26\n. This might be due to a lack of employing biomarkers at time of the diagnosis, combined with the biological heterogeneity of the MCI syndrome, as might have been the case with aMCI3, assigned to stage 0 due to an absence of biomarker changes. The follow up neuropsychological examination concluded a borderline normal functioning according to age and education, whereas the neuropsychological evaluation the year after concluded a normal cognitive and psychological functioning.\nAnother important consideration is the presence of alternative or co-occurring conditions that may transiently affect cognitive performance. For instance, depressive symptoms can lead to cognitive impairments that closely resemble MCI. When effectively treated, cognitive function may improve, leading to reversion. Furthermore, in some cases, fluctuating cognition may be an early symptom of Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB), which is characterized by attentional and executive variability [\n40\n,\n41\n,\n42\n].

However, in the research cohort, the non-amnestic MCI group only contained 9 subjects. In addition, one of the limitations of this EBM staging is that it applies a 'one size fits all' approach, which complicates the interpretation of borderline cases. Nevertheless, EBM-staging models can aid in including high-risk patients in clinical trials, and increase our understanding of the several factors that drive the different trajectories of AD.\nAnother important consideration is the increasingly recognized heterogeneity of the ADNI cohort, partly due to (undetected) limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 (LATE) or concomitant \u03b1-synuclein pathology [\n43\n,\n44\n]. This variability can pose significant challenges for disease progression modeling. EBM models trained on such heterogeneous samples may inadvertently capture patterns specific to certain subtypes, which can lead to overfitting, where the model performs well within the training cohort but lacks robustness and fails to generalize to other populations or patients with different disease trajectories.\nFurthermore, the presence of multiple underlying pathologies can introduce bias in how the model associates biomarkers, clinical features, or neuroimaging data with disease stages. For instance, LATE can clinically mimic AD but is driven by distinct neuropathology (TDP-43 vs. A\u03b2/tau) and tends to follow a slower, predominantly amnestic progression [\n43\n,\n45\n]. Without accounting for such variation, EBM models risk misclassification or misinterpretation of disease dynamics, limiting their clinical utility.\nIn addition, the EBM faces challenges in accurately staging disease progression in all cases, as evidenced by the uncertainties observed in the REMEMBER cohort.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/422", "#/texts/423", "#/texts/424", "#/texts/425", "#/texts/426", "#/texts/427", "#/texts/428", "#/texts/429", "#/texts/430", "#/texts/431", "#/texts/432", "#/texts/433"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "798f99ce-6c66-41c8-8d0f-280b2a80a86c"}

However, it needs to be noted that the EBM's reliance on specific biomarkers may limit its applicability in settings where certain biomarkers are not routinely assessed. Thus, the inclusion of specific biomarkers in EBM models also depends on their availability. CSF biomarkers can provide valuable diagnostic information, and the RAVLT may offer greater sensitivity than the MMSE for detecting cognitive decline (e.g., verbal memory impairment) [\n46\n]. Nevertheless, CSF biomarkers are not always accessible due to practical constraints associated with lumbar puncture, such as medical contraindications or patient refusal. In this context, it is also important to note that recent revisions to the ATN framework challenge the assumption of equivalence between biomarkers within the same category. Whereas the original 2018 NIA-AA framework grouped CSF and imaging biomarkers as interchangeable within each AT(N) category, newer evidence indicates that this equivalence does not always hold. Therefore, the revised criteria acknowledge potential discrepancies between imaging and biofluid biomarkers, further underlining the need to tailor model choice to biomarker availability and clinical applicability [\n11\n]. It also needs to be noted that it does not inherently make use of longitudinal data, especially when, even though this was not the case in this study, individuals have varying numbers of time-points, therefore not considering within-individual correlations which can lead to a considerable bias.\nThe EBM's intuitive design and simplicity lie in its ability to present a straightforward sequence of biomarker events.

However, well-managed heterogeneity-such as through stratification, subtype modeling, and multimodal inputs-can actually enhance generalizability by teaching the model about real-world variation. These approaches can refine the identification of distinct pathological subgroups, leading to more personalized predictions. When combined with methods to correct sample imbalance (e.g., stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and synthetic data generation), EBM can provide a promising framework for building models that are both technically robust and sensitive to the biological complexity of real-world clinical populations.\n\nIndependent validation and outlier analysis of EuroPOND Alzheimer's disease staging model using ADNI and real-world clinical data\nConclusion\nThis study showed that the event-based model for AD staging is generalizable, meaning that it can be trained on large cross-sectional historical datasets such as ADNI, and still have reliable staging results in new independent data, provided that the same biomarkers are used. This provides confidence towards using these models in multi-center trials, for instance, as a screening tool.
