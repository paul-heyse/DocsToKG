While much attention has focused on neurons and microglia, recent studies underscore the significant yet understudied roles of oligodendrocytes (OL) and oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPC) in AD pathology. OL, responsible for myelin production and maintenance, are impaired early in AD, contributing to demyelination, synaptic dysfunction, and cognitive decline. Emerging evidence reveals that A\u03b2 and tau pathology disrupt OPC differentiation and induce senescence, exacerbating neuroinflammation and reducing remyelination potential. Demyelination precedes overt AD symptoms, positioning it as a potential early biomarker. Furthermore, animal models reveal that OPC density and function deteriorate with age, particularly in the presence of A\u03b2 plaques, highlighting their vulnerability in the AD environment. Transcriptomic studies also link cholesterol biosynthesis and lipid metabolism dysregulation in OPC to AD progression, emphasizing the intricate relationship between OL, metabolic processes, and amyloid toxicity. Additionally, the identification of disease-associated oligodendrocytes (DAO), characterized by altered gene expression and proximity to A\u03b2 plaques, highlights their involvement in neuroinflammation and APP processing. This review synthesizes recent insights into OL and OPC dysfunction in AD, focusing on their roles in neuroinflammation, A\u03b2 clearance, and myelin integrity. It discusses the potential of targeting OL and OPC pathways, such as enhancing remyelination and mitigating senescence, as novel therapeutic strategies.

According to a 2022 report by the World Health Organization (WHO), over 55 million people are currently affected by dementia (World Health Organization\n2022\n). Epidemiological projections estimate that the number of cases will rise to 113 million by 2050, positioning AD as a growing public health and economic challenge (Wu et al.\n2017a\n). The distinctive pathological features of Alzheimer's disease, include the accumulation of insoluble amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) peptides and the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein which, as AD progresses, lead to the formation of senile plaques (SP) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), respectively, and progressively disrupt neuronal function and connectivity (Zhang et al.\n2024a\n; Abdelnour et al.\n2022\n).", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/39", "#/texts/40", "#/texts/42", "#/texts/43", "#/texts/44", "#/texts/46", "#/texts/47", "#/texts/48", "#/texts/50", "#/texts/51", "#/texts/52", "#/texts/53", "#/texts/54", "#/texts/55", "#/texts/56", "#/texts/57", "#/texts/58", "#/texts/60", "#/texts/61", "#/texts/62", "#/texts/63", "#/texts/64", "#/texts/65", "#/texts/66", "#/texts/67", "#/texts/68", "#/texts/69", "#/texts/70"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "4444804e-8dea-43b9-a111-351bae488be7"}

Generally, AD is categorized into genetic (familial) and sporadic forms, with the latter being the predominant type observed in clinical populations. Genetic AD is a rarely occurring subtype resulting from mutations in APP, PSEN1, or PSEN2, which drive early-onset AD (EOAD) neurodegeneration typically manifesting before the age of 65 (Maurer et al.\n1997\n). In contrast, sporadic AD, which comprises over 95% of cases, lacks a clear inheritance pattern and is primarily influenced by the\nAPOE4\nallele along with various environmental and epigenetic factor. EOAD, often associated with genetic mutations, exhibits a more aggressive disease course driven by increased A\u03b2 production, whereas late-onset AD (LOAD), is largely multifactorial, characterized by impaired A\u03b2 clearance, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress (Strobel\nn.d.\n). Despite advances in understanding pathology onset, and progression, the multifactorial nature of Alzheimer's disease has hindered the development of a unified theory. Several hypotheses, including the cholinergic, amyloid cascade, neuroinflammatory, and oxidative stress have been proposed, each shedding light on distinct aspects of the disease's complexity (Liu et al.\n2019\n).", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/71", "#/texts/72", "#/texts/73", "#/texts/74", "#/texts/75", "#/texts/76", "#/texts/77", "#/texts/78", "#/texts/79", "#/texts/80", "#/texts/81"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "938af149-8653-41c3-b729-8089aaab2ab3"}

However, the role of glial cells in this pathology is insufficiently understood. Microglia, the main immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS), are perceived as a major contributor to neuroinflammation and oxidative stress in AD. While microglial activation initially serves to clear A\u03b2 aggregates through phagocytosis, prolonged activation leads to chronic neuroinflammation, further exacerbating neuronal damage (Singh\n2022\n; Heneka et al.\n2013\n). This is largely attributed to their harmful activation through the interaction with A\u03b2 and reactive oxygen species (ROS), which triggers proinflammatory cytokine (e.g., IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6) and chemokine cascades (Bai et al.\n2022\n; Leng\n2021\n). This persistent inflammatory response disrupts synaptic plasticity, contributes to neuronal loss, and impairs cognitive functions. Additionally, microglial dysfunction in AD is associated with genetic risk factors such as mutations in the TREM2 gene, which encodes a receptor crucial for microglial phagocytic activity (Guerreiro et al.\n2013\n). Loss-of-function mutations in\nTREM2\nimpair microglial clearance of A\u03b2, leading to increased plaque burden and worsening disease pathology (Hou et al.\n2022\n; Zheng et al.\n2018\n).", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/82", "#/texts/83", "#/texts/84", "#/texts/85", "#/texts/86", "#/texts/87", "#/texts/88", "#/texts/89", "#/texts/90", "#/texts/91", "#/texts/92", "#/texts/93", "#/texts/94", "#/texts/95", "#/texts/96", "#/texts/97", "#/texts/98"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "99e98999-b94f-40d1-8cda-9be4b0d4177a"}

Reactive astrocytes undergo morphological changes, including hypertrophy and upregulation of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (Kato et al.\n1998\n). While these astrocytes can form a protective glial scar around A\u03b2 plaques to limit neurotoxicity, they may also contribute to neuroinflammation by releasing proinflammatory cytokines and ROS (Monterey et al.\n2021\n). The interaction between microglia, astrocytes, and neurons is essential for maintaining CNS homeostasis. However, in AD, dysfunctional crosstalk with microglia leads to sustained neuroinflammation and oxidative stress (Hansen et al.\n2018\n).

Like other glial cells, OL contribute to immunomodulation and the restoration of homeostasis during neuroinflammation (Theophanous et al.\n2024\n). However, their most essential function lies in the production and maintenance of the myelin sheath, which insulates axons to enable rapid and efficient electrical signal transduction (Neely et al.\n2022\n; Chen et al.\n2022\n). The process of myelination continues throughout life and facilitated not only by mature oligodendrocytes but also by oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPC), which proliferate and differentiate into functional oligodendrocytes (Maitre et al.\n2023\n). Emerging evidence has confirmed that myelin breakdown and disruptions at various stages of oligodendrogenesis are significant contributors to the development and progression of AD. Patterns of impaired myelin formation correlate with the expansion of A\u03b2 and NFT during neurodegeneration (Braak and Braak\n1996\n). Furthermore, demyelination appears to precede the onset of Alzheimer's disease symptoms, positioning this process as a potential early marker of neurodegeneration (Desai et al.\n2010\n,\n2009\n; Stokin et al.\n1979\n; Couttas et al.\n2016\n).\nThis review presents the latest insights into amyloid-\u03b2 and tau protein-induced disturbances in oligodendrocyte precursor cells, oligodendrocytes, and myelin.

This process occurs during both early postnatal development and adulthood. The production rate of oligodendrocytes declines with age, yet OPC remain abundant throughout adulthood, retaining the capacity for active proliferation and differentiation into mature oligodendrocytes within the CNS. In response to environmental or physiological demands, OPC, also referred to as N2 glia (NG2) or O2A cells (Nishiyama et al.\n2009\n; Galichet et al.\n2021\n; Duncan et al.\n2018\n), differentiate into OL. This process is intricately regulated by a network of molecular factors, signaling pathways (Tiane et al.\n2019\n; Sock and Wegner\n2019\n), and complex transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms (Tiane et al.\n2019\n). These processes are essential not only for proper myelination but also for the dynamic remyelination necessary to maintain CNS function and repair (Akay et al.\n2021\n). OPC play a pivotal role in a multitude of physiological processes, including autophagy, phagocytosis, and signal transduction via interactions with various cell types within the CNS.

In the A\u03b2 plaques environment, the production and accumulation of aggregates induces senescence in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells. This senescence shifts OPC towards proinflammatory phenotype, impairing their ability to differentiate and mature, thereby further exacerbating neurodegenerative processes (Zhang et al.\n2019\n). Transcriptomic research on adult OPC has revealed age-dependent alterations associated with remyelination failure, including a reduced expression of proteins critical for maintaining stem cell functions (e.g.,\nSOX2, SOX9, CDK1, CDK2 CHD7\nand\nARID1\n) and an upregulation of markers indicative of terminal differentiation states (e.g.,\nPLP, MBP, MOBP, MOG, CLDN11, SNCA, APOE\n, and\nPADI2\n). Disruptions in cholesterol homeostasis have also been observed, with a decline in the expression of genes related to biosynthesis and phagocytosis. This results in a diminished capacity of adult OPC to clear and recycle cholesterol, ultimately contributing to decreased cholesterol availability in the brain (Fuente et al.\n2020\n). Disturbed cholesterol biosynthesis and lipid metabolism are well-known AD hallmarks, and transcriptomic changes in adult OPC and the human hippocampus from AD patients overlap. Moreover, studies confirmed reduced gene expression of essential factors in cholesterol biosynthesis (e.g.,\nDHCR24, HMGCR, HMGCS, ACAT2, IDI1,\nand\nMVD\n) (Fuente et al.\n2020\n; Varma et al.\n2021\n).", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/154", "#/texts/155", "#/texts/156", "#/texts/157", "#/texts/158", "#/texts/159", "#/texts/160", "#/texts/161", "#/texts/162", "#/texts/163", "#/texts/164", "#/texts/165", "#/texts/166", "#/texts/167", "#/texts/168", "#/texts/169", "#/texts/170", "#/texts/171", "#/texts/172", "#/texts/173", "#/texts/174"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "f4376f18-d1d4-4913-9ae1-c2a8f9b91eb6"}

Progressive changes in 3xTg AD mice were primarily observed in 6-month-old animals as morphological atrophy, which intensified over time, leading to OPC hypertrophy surrounded by A\u03b2 plaques (Vanzulli et al.\n2020\n). Comparable disturbances in OPC have been documented in the APP/PS1 mouse model, with the earliest decline in progenitor cells number detected in 9-month-old animals. As the pathology advances, 14-month-old mice OPC exhibit pronounced morphological alterations, including cellular shrinkage, increased branching, and signs of dystrophy (Chacon-De-La-Rocha et al.\n2020\n). These findings demonstrate that while OPC degeneration and morphological disruption are characteristic markers of aging, AD appears to significantly accelerate the onset and progression of these pathological processes.\nOPC have emerged as pivotal players in the clearance of A\u03b2, with their dysfunction has been linked to disruptions caused by A\u03b2 accumulation. NG2 glial cells have been identified as novel contributors to A\u03b2 clearance through mechanisms such as autophagy and endocytosis.

The clearance of A\u03b2 and cellular debris by oligodendrocyte precursor cells leads to an upregulation of clusterin production (Beiter et al.\n2024\n), which could contribute to the worsening of AD pathology due to its role in mediating regulation of A\u03b2-induced neurotoxicity (Foster et al.\n2019\n). OPC from adult brain have also been identified as a cell type secreting A\u03b2\n1-42\n, which is likely released in vivo in association with defective oligodendrocyte differentiation. According to recent data, this pathology may play a crucial role in the initiation and progression of sporadic AD (Nihonmatsu-Kikuchi et al.\n2021\n). The restoration of the myelinating oligodendrocyte pool is also linked to morphological changes in OPC that occur in the presence of A\u03b2 plaques. In this context, OPC transition into senescent, proinflammatory cells that are unable to differentiate into mature oligodendrocytes.

Additionally, AD-associated oligodendroglial subpopulations are more abundant in females, while non-pathological populations are predominantly male. Beyond molecular differences, growing morphological evidence suggests that OL represent a heterogeneous population with distinct functional roles, such as varying preferences for axonal targets or differential sensitivity to myelination signals (Kamen et al.\n2022\n; Osanai et al.\n2022\n; Bechler et al.\n2015\n).

The role of oligodendrocytes is currently considered complementary in A\u03b2 plaque formation, even though the expression levels of amyloidogenic \u03b2-secretase 1 (\nBACE1\n) and amyloid precursor protein (\nAPP\n) genes is comparable to those in neurons. Specific deletion of the\nBace1\ngene in mice reduced oligodendrocyte-derived harmful plaque formation by 30%. Thus, oligodendrocytes have the capacity to generate sufficient A\u03b2 to contribute to plaque accumulation (Sasmita et al.\n2023\n,\n2024\n). A similar observation has been identified in AD mice lacking the oligodendrocyte-specific\nBace1\ngene.

This transmembrane protein, highly expressed in neurons and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, plays a prominent role in the inhibition of oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination in the CNS (Mi et al.\n2005\n; Shao et al.\n2017\n). As part of a receptor complex that signals to inhibit myelination, axonal regeneration, and synaptic plasticity, LINGO-1 binds to Nogo receptor (NgR) and p75 neurotrophin factor (p75\nNTR\n) (Mi et al.\n2004\n,\n2008\n; Zhou et al.\n2012\n).

Furthermore, proper development and maintenance of the myelin sheath is fundamental for axons protection, as they prevent ion leakage that could possibly disrupt the electrical potential essential for neuronal communication (Kondiles and Horner\n2018\n; Stadelmann et al.\n2019\n; Simons et al.\n2024\n).\nAlzheimer's disease is commonly associated with grey matter disruption, however, a growing body of evidence from both animal models and AD patients reveals that white matter (WM) damage and consequently, a reduction in the myelin sheath are also correlated with neurodegeneration and cognitive dysfunctions (Filley\n2021\n; Nasrabady et al.\n2018\n).

Importantly, the reduction in the CA1 hippocampus region and entorhinal cortex, as well as the decline in the function of oligodendrocytes, which were more prone to apoptosis, occurred prior to A\u03b2 plaques, even though OL degeneration was driven by soluble A\u03b2 oligomers (Desai et al.\n2010\n,\n2011\n).

Myelin basic protein, the second most abundant protein in the CNS (Huang et al.\n2024\n; M\u00fcller et al.\n2013\n; Bauer et al.\n2012\n), plays a crucial role in myelin sheath formation and maintenance, as it drives the assembly of myelin membranes through phase transitions mediated by hydrophobic interactions. MBP also establishes a barrier within the myelin sheath, expelling most soluble and membrane proteins to maintain the membrane's structural integrity (Aggarwal et al.\n2013\n).

The tauopathy mouse model P301S carrying the\nApoE4\nisoform exhibits various pathological hallmarks, namely: a larger area covered by hyperphosphorylated tau in the hippocampus, brain atrophy, thinner granule cell layers in the dentate gyrus (DG), and thinner layers of pyramidal cells in the CA1 region of the hippocampus.

While tau has been extensively studied in neurons, its role in other cell types is still very limited. Nevertheless, it has been proven that extracellular tau is internalized by microglia both in vitro and in vivo, and this process may contribute to cellular dysfunction, supporting the concept that tau secretion serves as a protective mechanism to limit intracellular toxicity associated with its pathological accumulation (Bol\u00f3s et al.\n2016\n). Moreover, in astrocytes tau accumulation, known as aging-related tau astrogliopathy (ARTAG), characterized by thorn-shaped astrocytes, may represent an early response to neuronal injury, barrier disruption, or mechanical stress, and in some cases may precede neuronal tau pathology in neurodegenerative diseases (Kovacs et al.\n2016\n; Kovacs\n2018\n).

Their reciprocal interactions with microglia, the resident brain immune cells, significantly influence neuroinflammatory processes. Such interactions exacerbate neuronal and myelin damage, thereby contributing to the progression of AD pathology (Rossi and Bovenkamp\n2024\n; Graham et al.\n2025\n).\nThe understanding of microglia-oligodendrocyte interactions remains limited; however, existing evidence underscores the critical role of microglia in promoting remyelination (Fig.\n2\n). Microglia actively facilitate the recruitment and differentiation of OPC into mature oligodendrocytes through the secretion of key factors such as transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-\u03b21) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), which enhance the efficiency of remyelination (Baaklini et al.\n2023\n). Both factors are significant in OL's maturation, although at different stages of development. TGF-\u03b21 is an important cell cycle regulator, and its signaling is crucial for oligodendrogenesis and postnatal myelination (Yu et al.\n2000\n; Palazuelos et al.\n2014\n). IGF-1, a neurotrophic factor responsible for A\u03b2 clearance and mitigation of AD pathologies, is indispensable for early myelin development (Arjunan et al.\n2023\n). The lack of microglia-derived IGF-1 results in hypomyelination at the beginning of life and a thinner myelin sheath with ultrastructural deficits in adult life (Rusin et al.\n2024\n). Notably, microglial support is pivotal for myelination specifically during adulthood, playing a crucial role in post-developmental myelin growth. At this stage, microglia prevent hypomyelination and influence myelin integrity through the TGF\u03b21-TGF\u03b2R1 signaling axis (McNamara et al.\n2023\n).\nFig. 2", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/485", "#/texts/486", "#/texts/487", "#/texts/488", "#/texts/489", "#/texts/490", "#/texts/491", "#/texts/492", "#/texts/493", "#/texts/494", "#/texts/495", "#/texts/496", "#/texts/497", "#/texts/498", "#/texts/499", "#/texts/500", "#/texts/501", "#/texts/502", "#/texts/503", "#/texts/504", "#/texts/505"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "14792ff5-40dd-47ad-8dfc-8e9a4aa301a4"}

This process, a defining feature of multiple sclerosis (MS), also observed in Alzheimer's disease, leads to the accumulation of significant amounts of myelin debris in the central nervous system, predominantly composed of myelin-associated glycoproteins (MAG), well-known inhibitors of remyelination (Chen et al.\n2023\n; McKerracher et al.\n1994\n). During the initial stages of the clearance process, microglia remove myelin debris through TREM2-mediated phagocytosis, thereby attempting to restore homeostasis (Traiffort et al.\n2020\n; Cignarella et al.\n2020\n). However, as demyelination progresses, peripheral immune cells infiltrate the CNS by crossing the BBB and attack the myelin sheath. This infiltration exacerbates inflammation, activating both microglia and astrocytes, and accelerates the accumulation of myelin debris (Gao et al.\n2024\n).\nThe accumulation of myelin debris directly impedes the proliferation and maturation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells into myelinating oligodendrocytes, leading to a failure in the remyelination process. This cascade of events perpetuates the cycle of neuroinflammation, demyelination, and impaired repair, further exacerbating CNS dysfunction (Prineas and Parratt\n2021\n). In this proinflammatory environment, activated microglia become increasingly focused on clearing myelin debris, a process that diminishes their protective response to A\u03b2 plaques.

They also contribute to OPC proliferation, the development of mature oligodendrocytes and the modulation of neuroinflammation (Hu et al.\n2023\n; Verkhratsky et al.\n2023\n). The complexity of these interactions significantly impacts the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease.\nAlthough astrocytes and oligodendrocytes originate from the same progenitor cells, they perform distinct functions once matured (Zuchero and Barres\n2013\n). Nevertheless, astrocytes undeniably influence OPC proliferation, survival, and differentiation into myelinating cells (Fig.\n2\n). Astrocytes release a range of trophic factors, including platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2), IGF-1, and TGF-\u03b2, which are involved in the survival and development of OPCs into mature oligodendrocytes that are critical for efficient neuronal signal transmission (Rawji et al.\n2020\n). Furthermore, astrocytes provide lactate-derived from glucose via monocarboxylate transporters (MCT), essential for axonal integrity and sustaining the high metabolic demands associated with myelin synthesis. However, astrocytes can also adopt inhibitory roles in remyelination. Reactive astrocytes can form glial scars that impede OPC migration and differentiation.

Oligodendrocyte precursor cells also contribute to vascular integrity by interacting with endothelial cells and pericytes. OPC secrete TGF-\u03b2, which enhances BBB function under physiological conditions. However, in pathological conditions, OPC dysfunction can exacerbate vascular permeability (Niu et al.\n2019\n; Seo et al.\n2014\n). Also, in response to injury, including AD, astrocytes contribute to glial scar formation, which is critical in restoring BBB integrity (Sousa\n2022\n). However, in demyelinating conditions, the glial scar also acts as a physical barrier that prevents OPC from accessing the demyelinated area and interacting with denuded neurons, thereby hindering remyelination (Wang et al.\n2011\n; Nair et al.\n2008\n; Silver and Miller\n2004\n; Fawcett and Asher\n1999\n).\nAlthough astrocytes and oligodendrocytes impact neuroinflammatory processes, their functions seem to differ. Astrocytes and OPC produce proinflammatory cytokines during neuroinflammation, including TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, which can have dual effects on the BBB integrity - either supporting or impairing it (Bennett et al.\n2010\n). These cytokines can also either protect or inhibit remyelination (Rawji et al.\n2020\n). It should be emphasized that inflammatory action is initiated by microglia, which contribute to the activation of other glial cells (Singh\n2022\n). While these cytokines can initially support OPC activation, chronic inflammation can suppress oligodendrocyte maturation and myelin repair (Liddelow and Barres\n2017\n).

Aging exacerbates the inhibitory effects of astrocytes on remyelination.

Additionally, the transcriptomic signature of DAO overlaps with that of disease-associated astrocytes (DAA) and microglia (DAM), including the upregulation of a similar set of genes (e.g.,\nC4b, Serpina3n, B2m\n) in response to amyloid and tau pathology. Despite these shared molecular features, glial cell types exhibit distinct functional profiles. For instance, astrocytes predominantly display interferon-related responses, whereas oligodendrocytes show changes associated with demyelination and apoptosis (Lee et al.\n2021\n). Moreover, while DAM activation is heavily dependent on TREM2, DAO activation appears to occur independently from TREM2 signaling. This distinction underscores the possibility that oligodendrocytes may respond directly to amyloid or tau pathology without requiring microglial signaling pathways (Zhou et al.\n2020\n). Understanding these shared yet distinct molecular pathways could inform the development of broader therapeutic strategies targeting glial cell dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases. Nevertheless, the observed divergence between species-specific and cell-specific responses highlights the critical need to address the limitations of translating findings from animal models directly to human conditions.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/657", "#/texts/658", "#/texts/659", "#/texts/660", "#/texts/661", "#/texts/662", "#/texts/663", "#/texts/664", "#/texts/665", "#/texts/666", "#/texts/667", "#/texts/668", "#/texts/669"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "210bb3fe-ef67-471f-b0bd-76f53e7a4cc2"}

Presented evidence underscores the crucial yet insufficiently understood role of oligodendrocytes and oligodendrocyte precursor cells in AD pathology. While traditionally considered a neuronal disorder, AD also involves substantial glial dysfunction, with OL and OPC contributing to disease progression through impaired myelination, disrupted lipid metabolism, and neuroinflammatory responses. Myelin breakdown precedes cognitive decline, suggesting that OL dysfunction may be an early neurodegeneration biomarker.\nA\u03b2 and tau pathology interfere with OPC differentiation and promote cellular senescence, exacerbating neuroinflammation and reducing remyelination potential. Animal models confirm age-dependent OPC decline, particularly in regions affected by A\u03b2 plaques, further supporting their vulnerability in AD. Transcriptomic studies link OL dysfunction to cholesterol metabolism disturbances, reinforcing the critical interplay between myelin integrity and amyloid toxicity. Additionally, identifying disease-associated oligodendrocytes underscores their active role in inflammatory pathways and APP processing.\nGiven the growing understanding of OL involvement in AD, targeting OL and OPC pathways presents a promising therapeutic avenue. Enhancing remyelination and mitigating OPC senescence may offer novel approaches to slow disease progression and improve cognitive outcomes. Further research is needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying OL dysfunction and develop targeted interventions to preserve myelin integrity in AD.\n\nEmerging Role of Oligodendrocytes Malfunction in the Progression of Alzheimer's Disease\nData Availability\nNo datasets were generated or analysed during the current study.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/671", "#/texts/672", "#/texts/673", "#/texts/675"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "54a9a881-f947-48a6-8b99-376cfdf47267"}
