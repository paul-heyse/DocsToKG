Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), affecting over 537 million adults worldwide, increases susceptibility to MCI, with higher cognitive decline prevalence in diabetic populations. Previous meta-analyses focused on isolated factors, neglecting multidimensional interactions. This study synthesizes T2DM-MCI risk factors across clinical, lifestyle, and biochemical dimensions to support early identification and intervention of cognitive dysfunction in T2DM populations.\nMaterials and Methods:\nThis systematic review and meta-analysis, following PRISMA guidelines, searched five databases for articles published from January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2024. Studies were screened based on predefined criteria, with data extracted independently by two researchers. Quality was assessed using Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) and Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) tools. Data were analyzed using RevMan software, with odds ratio (OR) and 95% CI as effect size measures. Heterogeneity was assessed using I\u00b2 statistics, and subgroup analyses were conducted for factors with \u226510 studies.\nResults:\n30 studies with 10,469 participants were included. Prevalence rate of MCI in T2DM was 44.1%. Significant associations were found between T2DM-MCI and age (OR = 1.06, P = 0.01), female sex (OR = 1.23, P = 0.05), diabetes duration (OR = 1.07, P = 0.03), education (OR = 0.82, P = 0.0001), smoking (OR = 1.44, P = 0.003), hypertension (OR = 2.25, P", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/216", "#/texts/217", "#/texts/218", "#/texts/219", "#/texts/220", "#/texts/221", "#/texts/222", "#/texts/223", "#/texts/224", "#/texts/225", "#/texts/226", "#/texts/227", "#/texts/228", "#/texts/229", "#/texts/230", "#/texts/231", "#/texts/232", "#/texts/233", "#/texts/234", "#/texts/235", "#/texts/236"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "479a2b4f-fbad-4330-9fb3-1ab7200ec887"}

Individuals with MCI exhibit significantly elevated risk of progressing dementia compared to cognitively healthy populations (\n2\n). Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), one of the most prevalent metabolic disorders globally, continues to show escalating prevalence rates. According to International Diabetes Federation (IDF), the global adult population with diabetes exceeded 537 million in 2021, over 90% of whom had T2DM, and this figure is projected to surpass 783 million by 2045 (\n3\n). Concurrently, cognitive health concerns in T2DM patients, particularly MCI comorbidity, have gained increasing attention. Studies indicated that T2DM not only serves as a risk factor for MCI but also accelerates its progression to dementia (\n4\n). Diabetic individuals have a 1.25 to 1.91 times higher likelihood of developing cognitive impairment than non-diabetic individuals (\n5\n). Epidemiological data suggest that the prevalence of MCI among T2DM patients ranges from 19.9% to 45.0% (\n6\n,\n7\n).\nMCI manifests through impairments in core cognitive domains, including memory (\n8\n) and executive function (\n9\n), and is associated with multiple adverse clinical outcomes. For instance, a meta-analysis revealed that older diabetic patients with comorbid MCI face a higher risk of falling (\n10\n). Assessments using the World Health Organization Quality of Life Assessment for Older Adults further demonstrated significantly reduced quality-of-life scores among MCI patients across dimensions such as autonomy, engagement in past/present activities, and social participation (\n11\n). These findings collectively highlight that MCI not only serves as an early indicator of cerebral functional decline in T2DM patients but also exacerbates the disease burden through multiple pathways.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/243", "#/texts/244", "#/texts/245", "#/texts/246", "#/texts/247", "#/texts/248", "#/texts/249", "#/texts/250", "#/texts/251", "#/texts/252", "#/texts/253", "#/texts/254", "#/texts/255", "#/texts/256", "#/texts/257", "#/texts/258", "#/texts/259", "#/texts/260", "#/texts/261", "#/texts/262", "#/texts/263", "#/texts/264", "#/texts/265", "#/texts/266"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "d71785bb-8368-4b97-a7cb-c93965911539"}

The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying T2DM-MCI comorbidity involve complex interactions: chronic hyperglycemia directly impairs cognitive function through the deposition of advanced glycation end-products (\n12\n,\n13\n), blood-brain barrier disruption (\n14\n,\n15\n), and hippocampal neuronal apoptosis (\n16\n,\n17\n). Notably, the MCI stage represents a reversible therapeutic window (\n18\n,\n19\n). Meta-analyses indicate that early identification and control of risk factors significantly reduce dementia conversion risks and subsequent healthcare expenditures (\n20\n). Comprehensive management strategies could potentially prevent or delay up to 40% of dementia cases (\n21\n), underscoring the need for proactive preventive measures.\nDespite established evidence on T2DM-MCI determinants, controversies persist regarding the heterogeneity of factors and their relative contributions. Existing meta-analyses predominantly focus on isolated factors, such as glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels (\n22\n),or diabetes duration (\n23\n), lacking systematic integration of multidimensional elements, including demographic/clinical characteristics, biochemical parameters, lifestyle factors, and disease management. For example, while some studies have reported significant associations between smoking history (\n24\n,\n25\n) and T2DM-MCI risk, others have fail to corroborate this relationship (\n26\n,\n27\n). Similarly, conflicting evidence exists fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and HbA1c, with some studies finding no significant association (\n28\n,\n29\n) and others reporting clear links (\n30\n,\n31\n). To address these inconsistencies, the present study conducts a meta-analysis to consolidate current evidence, systematically evaluating risk factors and their weighted contributions across four dimensions: demographic and clinical characteristics (including age, sex, and diabetes duration), lifestyle factors (smoking and alcohol consumption), disease management (hypertension and depression), and biochemical indicators (HbA1c). The aim is to provide evidence-based support for early identification and intervention of cognitive dysfunction in T2DM populations.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/267", "#/texts/268", "#/texts/269", "#/texts/270", "#/texts/271", "#/texts/272", "#/texts/273", "#/texts/274", "#/texts/275", "#/texts/276", "#/texts/277", "#/texts/278", "#/texts/279", "#/texts/280", "#/texts/281", "#/texts/282", "#/texts/283", "#/texts/284", "#/texts/285", "#/texts/286", "#/texts/287", "#/texts/288", "#/texts/289", "#/texts/290", "#/texts/291", "#/texts/292", "#/texts/293", "#/texts/294", "#/texts/295", "#/texts/296", "#/texts/297", "#/texts/298", "#/texts/299", "#/texts/300", "#/texts/301", "#/texts/302", "#/texts/303", "#/texts/304", "#/texts/305", "#/texts/306", "#/texts/307", "#/texts/308"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "e506dfb0-f5d3-45f9-a794-cb341478ee95"}

These findings align with Sun et al. (\n63\n), confirming age as a non-modifiable risk factor for MCI. Potential mechanisms include age-related neurodegeneration (e.g., neuronal loss, reduced synaptic density, and impaired cerebral energy metabolism) (\n64\n), compounded by elevated advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and oxidative stress in elderly T2DM patients (\n65\n), which synergistically accelerate vascular dysfunction and cognitive deterioration (\n66\n).\nFemale sex was identified as a significant risk factor for MCI in T2DM patients (OR = 1.48 vs. 0.91 in men), consistent with You et al. (\n67\n). While gender differences remain debated (\n68\n,\n69\n), emerging evidence suggests that the postmenopausal decline in estrogen may attenuate neuroprotective pathways (\n68\n,\n70\n). Additionally, sex-specific disparities in cardiovascular risks profiles (\n71\n), adiposity distribution patterns (\n72\n), and chronic inflammatory states (\n73\n) likely contribute to this association.

Furthermore, extended disease duration may induce structural and functional brain changes (e.g. accelerating cerebral atrophy and reduced synaptic density) and functional neurodegeneration (\n76\n), which collectively contribute to cognitive decline.\nLow educational attainment (\u2264 6 years) was associated with an increased risk of MCI (OR = 1.29, 95% CI: 0.80-0.97, P = 0.007), supporting the cognitive reserve hypothesis (\n77\n). Higher educational attainment may enhance neural plasticity and compensatory mechanisms, potentially delaying cognitive decline. Additionally, greater education may optimize neural network efficiency, helping maintain cognitive resilience despite chronic metabolic conditions such as diabetes (\n36\n).\nNo significant association was found between BMI and MCI risk in patients with T2DM (OR = 1.18, 95% CI: 0.94-1.49,\nP\n= 0.15). Although elevated BMI is associated with insulin resistance (\n78\n), adiposity-related inflammation (\n79\n), and cardiovascular risks (\n80\n)-factors that may indirectly impair cerebral metabolism and cognition- BMI was not independently associated with MCI in this cohort. This finding may reflect interactions between BMI and confounding variables (e.g., age, glycemic control, sex).

These findings align with previous studies (\n81\n,\n82\n), confirming smoking as a critical risk factor for T2DM-MCI comorbidity. For instance, Hagger-Johnson et al. (\n83\n) reported accelerated cognitive decline in middle-aged and elderly smokers, while Xia et al. (\n84\n) identified an inverse correlation between smoking intensity and serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels-a key mediator of neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity. Mechanistically, nicotine may impair cognition through interactions with nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits (e.g., \u03b14, \u03b22, and \u03b17) [ (\n85\n). Although precise pathways require further elucidation, the robust association between smoking and cognitive deterioration is well-established.\nIn contrast, alcohol consumption showed no significant association with T2DM-MCI comorbidity in this study (OR = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.36-1.80,\nP\n= 0.61). However, existing evidence (\n86\n) suggests a complex dose-response dynamic, including U-shaped or J-shaped relationships.

Chronic hypertension induces structural and functional cerebrovascular damage through ischemic white matter injury and microvascular pathology, reducing cerebral blood flow and accelerating cognitive decline (\n91\n). Similarly, CVD significantly elevates MCI risk (OR = 2.61, 95% CI: 1.99-3.43,\nP\n92\n). Post-stroke cerebrovascular injuries-particularly those involving extracranial carotid or intracranial vascular lesions (\n93\n)-are strongly associated with cognitive impairment in diabetic populations. Notably, diabetic stroke survivors with larger infarct volumes exhibit pronounced cognitive deficits, substantially increasing post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) risk (\n94\n).

Chronic hyperglycemia impairs glial cell function, inducing cerebrovascular pathology and neuronal damage that ultimately compromise cognition (\n102\n). Zheng et al.

First, the generalizability of the findings may be constrained by geographical and population homogeneity, as most of the included studies focused on Chinese populations, with limited representation of other ethnic or regional groups. Second, methodological heterogeneity-including variability in study designs (e.g., cross-sectional vs. cohort), sample sizes, and quality-likely contributed to substantial heterogeneity, which introduces a cautious interpretation of pooled estimates. Third, the predominance of cross-sectional designs (which constitute a high proportion of the included studies) precludes causal inference or longitudinal trajectory analysis. To address these limitations, future research should prioritize large-scale, multi-center cohort studies with extended follow-up periods to validate the identified risk factors. Additionally, a systematic investigation of unexplored confounders (e.g., genetic predisposition, lifestyle interactions) and mechanistic pathways is warranted to comprehensively elucidate T2DM-MCI pathophysiology.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/746", "#/texts/747", "#/texts/748", "#/texts/749", "#/texts/750", "#/texts/751", "#/texts/752", "#/texts/753", "#/texts/754", "#/texts/756"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "4c5c1984-53fb-467d-8896-4a2bcdc8c001"}
