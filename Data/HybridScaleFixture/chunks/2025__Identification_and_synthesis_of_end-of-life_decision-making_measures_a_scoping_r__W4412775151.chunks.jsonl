The intersection of aging and CI holds particular significance in end-of-life (EoL) care, given that cognitive decline is known to impact decision-making (DM) ability and that decisions affecting EoL are often irreversible and of profound consequence. EoL decision-making refers to the process of making choices about medical treatments and care options, as well as the overall approach to care for individuals nearing the end of their lives. These decisions often involve discussions about the use of life-sustaining measures, pain management, and the individual's preferences for their final days (\n2\n). It is particularly important to assess an individual's decision-making ability in the context of EoL given that advance care planning discussions are often delayed and issues around deciding about aggressive treatment (e.g., resuscitation planning), pain management, and general preferences near the end of one's life often arise when a person has not engaged in discussing such topics previously (\n3\n). Other areas of the EoL domain require decisions about aspects of life such as awareness of future disability and perceived risk, whether one wants to extend their life as much as possible despite risks, decisions about living situations including assisted care facilities and caregivers, and the creation and initiation of plans to meet goals (\n4\n).", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/258", "#/texts/259", "#/texts/260", "#/texts/261", "#/texts/262", "#/texts/263", "#/texts/264", "#/texts/265", "#/texts/266"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "4e4e5dfb-d280-4fa4-9f10-a0de2d88375c"}

The topic is further complicated by the fact that critically ill patients often also have some degree of decisional impairment (\n5\n). Because of this challenge, EoL decision-making is sometimes diverted from the patient (\n5\n,\n6\n) to a surrogate, despite the fact that surrogates may poorly represent an individual's preferences or choices (\n6\n). In a systematic review conducted by Sellars et al. (\n7\n), it was noted that carers often experience uncertainty in making EoL decisions and adhering to advance care planning (ACP) preferences on behalf of persons with dementia. Indeed, we know little about how to manage the inclusion of these surrogates when impairment is apparent. Yet, systematic reviews of how persons with limited decision-making capacity are meaningfully involved in ACP interventions are rare (\n8\n).\nIt is important to distinguish between decision-making capacity and decision-making ability, as these terms are often used interchangeably. Decision-making capacity has a distinct legal and clinical definition that refers to an individual's ability to make informed choices, typically assessed via a specific framework that includes the ability to understand relevant information, appreciate the situation and its consequences, reason about options, and communicate a choice. In contrast, decision-making ability is a less restrictive construct that reflects a person's general means to make decisions in alignment with their values and goals, without significant lapses in judgment. It is not a legal threshold but rather a clinical and ethical consideration that evaluates how well someone can navigate complex choices, particularly in critical and emotionally taxing contexts, such as end-of-life care. While this scoping review aims to focus on decision-making ability measures, decisional preferences, or an individual's values, beliefs, and priorities that guide how they make choices, is something that must be considered as they may be greatly impacted by decision-making ability.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/267", "#/texts/268", "#/texts/269", "#/texts/270", "#/texts/271", "#/texts/272", "#/texts/273", "#/texts/274", "#/texts/275", "#/texts/276", "#/texts/277", "#/texts/278", "#/texts/279", "#/texts/280"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "0eda7ee1-3bf2-4366-9de1-29e32b1ea175"}

A significant portion of EoL research focuses on conflict in decisions between multiple options or preferences, including how they want their pain to be managed, where they want to die, whether they want life-sustaining treatment, ongoing care needs, etc. (\n9\n-\n11\n). Ultimately, these topics are indirectly associated with DM ability; decision preferences, conflict, and regret are often consequences of impaired DM rather than components of DM ability itself (\n12\n). Moreover, individuals with CI often experience diminished self-esteem and confidence in expressing their opinions due to their awareness of the disease and associated memory loss, which can further impact how they express their decisions (\n12\n). Family caregivers and other healthcare proxies face similar dilemmas when making decisions on behalf of cognitively impaired persons (\n11\n,\n13\n), all of which highlight the need for assessments that acknowledge the nuances of this topic. For this reason, DM assessment is necessary to ensure that individuals and other persons involved in the EoL process understand their situation and the range of possible consequences of their decisions.\nWhen assessing DM ability for EoL care, many other considerations must be taken into account. For example, it may be difficult to ensure that a patient's decision is consistent with their long-term values and beliefs, particularly in clinical populations with dementia or psychiatric disorders that may affect an individual's judgment (\n14\n). It is also important to ensure that a patient's decisions are made voluntarily and without the influence of others who may try to take advantage of this vulnerable population for their own benefit (\n14\n). In the case of physician-assisted dying (PAD), patients must be able to understand their diagnosis and condition, as well as alternatives to suicide, the possible consequences of survival with injury, and the impacts of their decisions on survivors (\n14\n).", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/281", "#/texts/282", "#/texts/283", "#/texts/284", "#/texts/285", "#/texts/286", "#/texts/287", "#/texts/288", "#/texts/289", "#/texts/290", "#/texts/291", "#/texts/292", "#/texts/293", "#/texts/294", "#/texts/295", "#/texts/296", "#/texts/297", "#/texts/298", "#/texts/299", "#/texts/300"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "7edd3da6-31ee-4b17-96e6-6223936f7293"}

The aim of this study is to review existing measures that can gauge patients' decisional ability about EoL choices. This review will provide a foundation for an EoL care decision model that is not influenced by physician predictions and/or surrogate inclinations (\n5\n). This scoping review on EoL DM is part of a larger multidomain review to support the Advancing Reliable Measurement in Cognitive Aging and Decision-making Ability (ARMCADA) study (\n15\n). ARMCADA aims to develop and validate a battery of measures that assess multiple DM domains in older adults. In addition to providing a state of the field, the results from the scoping review will help support the identification of common DM tools used to develop a comprehensive suite of DM measures for use across health and cognitively impaired older adults.\nTo accomplish this goal, we conducted a scoping review to summarize the current state of DM ability measures available. Importantly, the review took a broad approach by including any paper that tested participants aged 45 years and older to assess decision-making abilities in mid-life and track potential earlier changes in cognitive changes and neurodegeneration. This research addresses gaps in EoL measurement; namely, that DM measures tend to focus on preferences, and often do not contain assessments of ability to plan for ones' end-of-life care. Furthermore, focusing on middle-aged groups and above recognizes that end-of-life (EoL) decision-making can occur early in life-particularly when individuals are aware of a potential future illness, such as neurodegenerative diseases identifiable through biomarkers or genetic testing (\n16\n). While it is important to acknowledge the rise of populations impacted by cognitive impairment, it is also important to recognize that cognitive impairment is not exclusive to neurodegenerative diseases in older adults, such as Dementia of the Alzheimer's Type (DAT), but also affects other clinical populations, including those with chronic illnesses and conditions that may lead to early cognitive changes (\n17\n-\n19\n). Understanding the range and properties of measures that address EoL DM ability will be of use to healthcare providers and families and will better allow patients to be active participants in deciding what their needs are at the end of their life.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/301", "#/texts/302", "#/texts/303", "#/texts/304", "#/texts/305", "#/texts/306", "#/texts/307", "#/texts/308", "#/texts/309", "#/texts/310", "#/texts/311", "#/texts/312"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "e30a7dba-77cf-4d5c-97bf-dbbfa4bcf4da"}

Following the identification of research questions (\n15\n), an inclusion criterion and search strategy were developed.\nA clinical librarian searched EMBASE (Elsevier), MEDLINE (Ovid), PsycINFO (EbscoHost), Cochrane Library (Wiley), Web of Science (Clarivate), and Scopus (Elsevier) for studies that met our criteria for each DM domain and were published from 1st January 2018 to 6th November 2023. By concentrating on literature published in the past 5 years at the time of the review, we aimed to identify the measures most commonly used in current research and practice, as well as to highlight emerging gaps that may not have been evident in earlier studies.

Standardized measures capable of evaluating DM in patients with CI, dementia, and other conditions that may affect DM ability are crucial for both practitioners and for the advancement of research on this topic. EoL DM measures should ensure patients' autonomy and enable healthcare providers, family members, and/or proxies to better respect and uphold patients' wishes during the decision-making process. This study set out to review the range of existing measures of EoL DM, describe their characteristics, and identify gaps in the literature where further measurement strategies may be necessary. The results will both inform the state of the field of DM abilities in an EoL context and support the development of the ARMCADA suite of measures to assess multiple domains of DM in older adulthood.\nResults from a multi-domain scoping review of DM in participants aged 45 + years, published between 2018 and 2023, found that only 34 articles included measures of EoL decision-making in older adults. Of those 34, there was little consistency in the use of standardized measures to assess end-of-life decision-making ability. The most commonly used measure was the MacCAT-T (\n24\n), followed by the Decisional Conflict Scale (\n25\n); however, the majority of articles employed a measure that was not used in any of the other studies in the dataset. As such, these findings suggest a critical gap in the current state of DM research: the lack of robust measures to assess DM ability in terminally ill patients, especially those with CI or dementia. Most existing measures tended to focus on decisional preferences and decisional outcomes rather than the ability to understand and make informed choices about EoL care options. Despite this, the inclusion of these measures was deliberate and grounded in the recognition that EoL decision-making is inherently multifaceted, influenced not only by cognitive ability but also by individual values, preferences, and perceived outcomes.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/475", "#/texts/476", "#/texts/477", "#/texts/478", "#/texts/479", "#/texts/480"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "f2b00a0b-1152-496b-8342-da16d6ad71bb"}

In such cases, tools that incorporate these elements can help surrogates and clinicians infer and honor the individual's values and wishes (\n28\n). Incorporating measures of preferences and outcomes alongside those of decision-making ability allows for an integrated understanding of EoL decision-making and lays the groundwork for the development of more robust and comprehensive assessment tools-ones that reflect the complexity of real-world decision-making and support more person-centered care. Future measurement efforts would benefit from building on this integrative approach, examining how these constructs interact, and exploring how such integration can improve the utility of DM ability assessments in clinical settings.\nOur results also showed that very few measures identified in our search had been used or validated in populations with CI. Persons with CI and various dementias generally have substandard EoL care, including more severe untreated symptoms, increased suffering, and a generally lower quality of life compared to patients with cancer (\n6\n). Although CI patients may have a lower capability to express suffering and preferences at the end of their lives, it is important to assess this ability to establish an EoL plan in which decisions are not solely left in the hands of proxies, healthcare providers, and/or family members. Assessing EoL-focused DM ability at the onset of symptoms and as the disease progresses is one way in which persons with CI and dementia can take an active role in their EoL care and is the reason our search included such a broad age range.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/481", "#/texts/482", "#/texts/483", "#/texts/484", "#/texts/485", "#/texts/486"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "8e903797-999d-44ed-a47b-a3cbb5f3fb09"}

For example, Rego et al. (\n9\n) found that spiritual wellbeing significantly correlated with better quality of life in palliative care and was associated with less decisional conflict. Furthermore, cultural norms may heavily influence whether decisions are to be made by an individual or their family members. In collectivist cultures, individuals tend to opt in for a shared decision-making process (\n29\n). While this scoping review did not primarily focus on such cultural dynamics, their relevance to EoL care underscores the need for a more holistic approach to evaluating and supporting decision-making, and future research should emphasize these additional dimensions.\nFurthermore, the context of where EoL decisions happen can vary greatly and occur beyond the walls of hospital settings. Many of the measures identified in this scoping review relied on the presence of a physician or trained clinician capable of administering measures in a semi-structured interview format. Yet, this does not reflect the reality of many individuals nearing the end of their lives. In practice, EoL decisions are made in diverse environments, including hospices, long-term care facilities, and-increasingly-people's homes. In such cases, physicians may not be present to assess one's decision-making ability and preferences, despite how critical and time-sensitive these matters are. Given this variability in setting and varying levels of experience, tools that require extensive training, time, and in-person administration may not be practical. As such, the development of remote, culturally adaptable, brief, and easily administered assessments is essential. These tools must be both clinically valid and sensitive to the contextual nuances of EoL care, including cultural values, emotional dynamics, and cognitive and decision-making ability fluctuations that can occur rapidly as a person nears death.

For example, we included 'advanced care planning' and 'terminal care', which may not have fully captured individual decision-making and instead emphasized shared decision-making-a criterion excluded from this review. However, our use of inclusive terms such as \"end of life\" and \"mental capacity\" combined with our broad decision-making terms should still have ensured a comprehensive search. Another limitation is that our review excluded gray literature, and the results may be impacted by publication bias. Additionally, case studies, which were also excluded from the current review, may be able to offer further insights, particularly in scenarios where conventional approaches may not apply, such as middle-aged patients proactively undergoing decision-making ability testing in longitudinal studies spanning their lifespan until EoL. Many articles included in the current review did not provide much insight into the psychometric quality of the measures they used. Future research employing existing EoL decision-making measures, as well as studies developing new tools, should prioritize validating these instruments across diverse clinical populations, cultural contexts, and languages. This is crucial because the reliability and validity of a measure can vary significantly depending on the demographic and situational context in which it is applied. Ensuring cross-contextual robustness will enhance the generalizability and utility of these measures and therefore have the potential to greatly improve end-of-life care and decision-making processes of patients.

The review underscores the scarcity of consistent, robust measures to assess DM ability, with the majority of studies employing unique, non-recurring measures. These findings emphasize the need for culturally relevant, adaptable, and validated tools that not only respect patient autonomy but also empower individuals with CI to engage in EoL planning from the onset of symptoms. The review also highlights a need to clearly distinguish between decision-making ability, decision-making capacity, decision-making competence, and decision-making preference, as this can greatly influence where it is used and what contexts it is suitable for. Addressing these gaps could improve the quality of EoL care for cognitively impaired populations and ensure that patients' preferences are upheld. These results provide valuable insights to inform future research and the development of the ARMCADA suite of DM measures.\n\nIdentification and synthesis of end-of-life decision-making measures: a scoping review\nData availability statement\nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/\nSupplementary material\n, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/494", "#/texts/496", "#/texts/497", "#/texts/498"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "5e7f3f37-1882-497a-be41-5b30956c6dc4"}
