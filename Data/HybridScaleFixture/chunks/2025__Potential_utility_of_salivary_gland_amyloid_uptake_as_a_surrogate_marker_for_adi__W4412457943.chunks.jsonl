Given the adipose-rich nature of salivary glands, we investigated whether A\u03b2 uptake in the salivary glands is associated with the link between BMI and cerebral A\u03b2 deposition using\n18\nF-Florbetaben PET/CT. We analyzed data from 187 participants, classified into A\u03b2\n\u2212\ncognitively normal (A\u03b2\n\u2212\nCN), A\u03b2\n+\nmild cognitive impairment (A\u03b2\n+\nMCI), and A\u03b2\n+\nAD dementia (A\u03b2\n+\nD) groups. BMI, standardized uptake value ratio of salivary glands (SUVR\nSG\n), and brain (SUVR\nB\n) were quantified, and their associations were examined using Pearson correlation and multiple regression analyses. Higher BMI was correlated with increased SUVR\nSG\n(\nr\n=\u20090.231,\np\n=\u20090.0019) and decreased SUVR\nB\n(\nr\n= -0.247,\np\n=\u20090.0009). SUVR\nSG\nand SUVR\nB\nwere negatively correlated (\nr\n= -0.188,\np\n=\u20090.0102). Multiple regression analysis identified BMI as an independent predictor of composite brain SUVR (\u03b2 = -0.0168,\np\n=\u20090.0046), while SUVR\nSG\nwas marginally significant (\u03b2 = -0.0714,\np\n=\u20090.0701). Regionally, both BMI and SUVR\nSG\nwere significantly associated with lower SUVR\nB\nin the striatum, precuneus, and cingulate cortex. Consistent with previous studies, BMI exhibited an inverse correlation with SUVR\nB\n. Notably, SUVR\nSG\nwas negatively associated with SUVR\nB\nwhile demonstrating a positive correlation with BMI.

The aggregation of A\u03b2 is a key pathological hallmark of AD, contributing to synaptic dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and neuronal degeneration, thus making it a crucial focus in understanding AD pathogenesis\n2\n.\nThe relationship between body mass index (BMI) and AD has been extensively investigated, revealing intriguing temporal variations across the lifespan. While midlife obesity correlates with elevated AD risk\n3\n,\n4\nand has been associated with enhanced A\u03b2 deposition and neurodegeneration, the late-life BMI profile presents a contrasting pattern. Specifically, reduced BMI in older adults demonstrates a significant correlation with increased cerebral A\u03b2 burden, particularly within the 1-2 years preceding positron emission tomography assessment\n5\n. This pattern is further complicated by the fact that increased visceral adiposity in the elderly corresponds with cortical thinning-a negative marker of AD progression-most prominently in the temporal, parietal, and cingulate regions\n6\n.\nThese findings collectively suggest that adipose tissue and related metabolic factors may substantially influence A\u03b2 accumulation dynamics and neurodegenerative processes, though the precise mechanistic pathways underlying these relationships remain undefined. Studies on the association of adipose tissue metabolism with AD pathology indicate that glucose metabolism measured from visceral adipose tissue was significantly associated with cerebral A\u03b2 burden, suggesting that metabolic dysfunction of adipose tissue could contribute to AD development\n7\n.

SGs have demonstrated a potential metabolic link with BMI\n8\nand MRI-based fat quantification studies reveal that fat content in the parotid and submandibular glands increases in proportion to BMI\n9\n. Furthermore, obesity has been linked to decreased salivary flow rates, emphasizing the broader metabolic implications of SG function\n10\n. Given their adipose-rich nature and metabolic activity, SGs may serve as a surrogate indicator of adipose tissue involvement in systemic amyloid dynamics.\nThe degree of brain amyloid accumulation can be assessed via molecular imaging techniques using positron emission tomography (PET) with various amyloid-specific radiotracers, including\n11\nC-Pittsburgh compound B (PiB)\n11\n,\n18\nF-florbetapir\n12\n,\n18\nF-florbetaben\n13\n,  and\n18\nF-flutemetamol\n14\n. Notably, salivary glands, particularly the parotid glands, are within the field of view in amyloid PET scans, allowing for their assessment without additional imaging protocols or modifications. This accessibility makes them a convenient target for evaluating amyloid uptake in adipose tissue.\nThis study not only quantifies brain uptake but also evaluates amyloid uptake in the salivary glands using amyloid PET imaging. Our primary objective is to determine whether BMI is associated with amyloid retention in SGs and whether this uptake is linked to brain A\u03b2 burden.

The precuneus serves as a critical site for early amyloid accumulation\n30\nwith visceral adiposity specifically linked to enhanced pathology in this region among middle-aged men\n31\n.

This pattern mirrors previous observations that women exhibit stronger microglial activation, a key component of neuroinflammation, independent of A\u03b2 burden, particularly during early AD stages\n36\n. Additionally, visceral adiposity-related biomarkers including VAT, CRP, and PAI-1 demonstrate more pronounced associations with AD pathology in women\n37\n.
