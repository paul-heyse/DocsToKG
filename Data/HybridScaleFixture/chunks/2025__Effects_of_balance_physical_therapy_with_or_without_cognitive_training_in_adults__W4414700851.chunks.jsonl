Although physical activity is essential for dementia prevention, older adults often struggle with balance issues, fear of falling, and reduced mobility. This study investigated the impact of balance training, alone or combined with cognitive exercises, on functional balance and cognitive performance in individuals with cognitive impairments.\nMethods A comprehensive literature search was conducted across three electronic databases to identify peerreviewed studies written in English that examined the effects of balance-oriented physical therapy, either alone or in combination with cognitive training, on individuals with cognitive or concurrent cognitive and balance impairments. The outcomes of interest included balance and cognitive function. The risk of bias was evaluated independently by two reviewers using the ROB-1 tool. The effectiveness of the intervention was analyzed using RevMan software.\nResults This systematic review found that stand-alone physical exercise significantly improved postural stability in 15 out of 24 studies and enhanced cognitive function in 5 out of 25 studies. Furthermore, the integration of cognitive training alongside physical exercise demonstrated additional benefits in improving balance and cognition in 7 out of 11 studies. These findings suggest that such interventions may be beneficial for older adults with cognitive impairments, warranting further research to establish definitive conclusions.\nConclusion This systematic review emphasizes the potential benefits of physical balance exercises, often combined with cognitive training, in improving balance, cognitive function, and certain aspects of quality of life among individuals with cognitive impairment.\nKeywords Balance training, Balance exercises, Balance physiotherapy, Cognitive exercises, Cognitive training, Cognitive impairment, Cognitive disorders, Cognitive dysfunction, Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Dementia, And Alzheimer's disease\n$^{1}$Faculty of medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand $^{2}$National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece $^{3}$University College London, London, United Kingdom\n&lt;!-- image --&gt;\n&lt;!-- image --&gt;", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/5", "#/texts/6", "#/texts/7", "#/texts/8", "#/texts/9", "#/texts/10", "#/pictures/1", "#/pictures/2"], "page_nos": [1], "uuid": "da621236-d6bd-4433-8253-18ce989f541e"}

Studies indicate that individuals experiencing gait difficulties face nearly double the risk of developing dementia (hazard ratio 1.96 [95% CI 1.30 to 2.96]) [ 3]. Moreover, individuals diagnosed with MCI are particularly vulnerable to falls due to gait abnormalities, diminished balance control, and reduced physical capacity [ 4]. Estimates suggest that the global prevalence of MCI ranges from 5.0 to 36.7% [ 5].\nRecent evidence indicates that targeted exercise regimens and multifactorial interventions are promising in improving postural control, cognitive function, and fall incidence among individuals with MCI [ 6], potentially slowing the progression towards dementia [ 7]. Guidelines from organizations such as the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the UK [ 8] and the American Physical Therapy Association [ 9] emphasizes the importance of balance-focused physiotherapy, including both static and dynamic exercises, as a primary intervention for balance-related disorders. Reviews from Cochrane have also provided moderate to strong evidence supporting the benefits of balance rehabilitation in individuals with vestibular conditions [ 10] and those recovering from stroke [ 11].\nUnfortunately, access to specialized balance rehabilitation services is limited or unavailable in many countries due to shortages of specialized professionals and healthcare resources to adequately address the needs of an aging population [ 12]. Additionally, prevalent homebased exercise programs often have a 50% attrition rate in follow-up [ 13]. These programs also have shortcomings, such as the absence of multisensory and cognitive components and a lack of focus on practical challenges, such as navigating crowded environments or complex settings like supermarkets [ 14, 15]. It is recommended that interventions should be tailored and individualized following thorough assessments and conducted under supervision to improve adherence [ 9].\nHowever, the demand for these interventions exceeds the availability of proficient experts capable of delivering these services to middle-aged and older adults dealing with balance disorders and increased fall risks. To enhance adherence, interventions should be personalized based on comprehensive assessments and conducted under supervision when possible.\nGiven the increasing demand for specialized interventions, there is a growing need to evaluate their accessibility and effectiveness for middle-aged and older adults experiencing balance impairments and heightened fall risks.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/14", "#/texts/15", "#/texts/16", "#/texts/17", "#/texts/18"], "page_nos": [1], "uuid": "a4b1f9bf-9d5f-440d-ad4a-2523c0f631f5"}

We reviewed 25 studies and evaluated their quality using the ROB-1 tool [18]. Out of these, eight studies specifically addressed the effects of balance training on cognitive function in older adults, with seven focusing on mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and one examining amnichest MCI (aMCI). The interventions demonstrated significant improvements in cognitive abilities, including executive functions, cognitive scores (ADAS-Cog, MOCA), and reductions in depressive symptoms, highlighting the efficacy of physical therapy in enhancing cognitive health\nand potentially managing cognitive decline in MCI patients. The study on aMCI [42] also indicated significant cognitive improvements, suggesting the benefits of physical therapy across different cognitive conditions.\nOut of the 25 studies analyzed, 24 explored the impact of physical therapy on balance among other outcomes, with 15 studies demonstrating significant improvements. These studies showed significant improvements in balance metrics such as the TUG and BBS across various subgroups, including those with MCI, AD, dementia, and cognitive frailty. Most studies have reported positive effects on balance.\nAmong the studies that examined the impact of dualtask exercises, 7 out of 11 showed positive outcomes. These exercises, which integrate physical and cognitive tasks, proved particularly effective at boosting both cognitive and physical abilities, suggesting their value in holistic cognitive rehabilitation approaches.\nThe research also demonstrated gains in wider functional capabilities and quality of life. This included improvements in daily problem-solving, mental healthrelated quality of life, mobility, muscle strength, and effectiveness in preventing falls, all of which are essential for maintaining the independence and overall well-being of individuals with cognitive impairments.\nThe systematic review indicates that physical therapy interventions, including balance and cognitive training, significantly improve cognitive functions, postural\n\nTable 5 Summary of outcome measures and statistical significance in included RCTs", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/153", "#/texts/154", "#/texts/155", "#/texts/156", "#/texts/157", "#/texts/158", "#/texts/162", "#/tables/7"], "page_nos": [1], "uuid": "f593e9ae-e974-447c-ac48-ffe64dcbd32c"}

Additionally, the combined training group showed a significant improvement in mobility compared to no intervention (MD - 1.80; 95% CI - 2.70 to - 0.90; I2 = 0%; 81 participants). Ali et al. [45] reported similar results, where dual-task training led to improvements across various cognitive domains: global cognitive function (SMD = 0.24, P = 0.002), memory (SMD = 0.28, P = 0.001), executive function (SMD = 0.35, P\nstatuses suggests a potential protective role of physical activity against cognitive decline before the onset of dementia.

Our study offers a comprehensive analysis of multiple outcomes-balance, cognitive function, functional improvements, and quality of lifeproviding a well-rounded understanding of the impact of balance training interventions. By including both single-task and dual-task (balance plus cognitive) training programs, we offer nuanced insights into effective rehabilitation strategies tailored to this vulnerable population. A significant advantage of this review is the comprehensive and transparent assessment of risk of bias across all\nincluded RCTs, as illustrated in Figs. 2 and 3. Most studies reported adequate randomization methods and blinding of participants or outcome assessors, which enhances the internal validity of our findings. Furthermore, any discrepancies in risk of bias judgments were resolved through consensus with a third reviewer, ensuring methodological rigor and reliability in the quality appraisal process. Additionally, detailed reporting of intervention characteristics-such as frequency, duration, and exercise type-enhances the clinical applicability and reproducibility of our findings. Our adherence to PRISMA 2020 guidelines further strengthens the transparency and methodological quality of this review. Importantly, by evaluating a broad range of outcome domains-including cognitive function, balance, mobility, muscle strength, and quality of life-our review captures the multifaceted benefits of balance training, underscoring its potential to improve the overall well-being and functional independence of individuals with mild cognitive impairment.\nThis systematic review has several limitations. One significant limitation is the absence of a formal meta-analysis. Although many studies reported similar outcome measures, such as the BBS, TUG, and SPPB, the high variability in intervention types, training parameters, and study populations-particularly among individuals with cognitive impairment-restricted our ability to statistically pool the data with adequate confidence. Previous reviews, such as those by Lesinski et al. [47], successfully conducted meta-analyses and established dose-response relationships for balance training in healthy older adults. However, their findings were based on more homogeneous populations and well-defined training protocols. In contrast, the studies we included often lacked detailed reporting on training volume and intensity, which are essential for synthesizing dose-response effects.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/167", "#/texts/171", "#/texts/172"], "page_nos": [1], "uuid": "a6a5c81b-6339-434b-bdbd-58ec5f348311"}

[48], many original studies do not contextualize their results within previous systematic reviews, our review reflects a broader challenge in the field where the accumulation of comparable, high-quality data remains limited. Furthermore, our literature search was confined to English-language publications, potentially excluding relevant studies amid the expanding research on MCI globally. Future studies should concentrate on targeted interventions addressing cognitive issues in older adults, with the goal of slowing or preventing the progression of cognitive decline in MCI, dementia, and Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, further research is needed to determine the optimal intensity, duration, frequency, and structure of balance and dual-task training programs to achieve sustained functional and cognitive benefits, as emphasized by Lesinski et al. [47].\nAnother limitation of our review is that, while several included studies reported statistically significant\nimprovements in cognitive and balance outcomes, we did not assess whether these changes were clinically meaningful. We did not utilize a distribution-based approach to derive minimal clinically important differences (MCIDs) from baseline values, as recommended by Watt et al. [49].\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, this analysis of 25 studies highlights the significant impact of balance training-whether or not it includes cognitive components-on improving balance, cognitive function, and overall functional outcomes in individuals with cognitive impairment. Most studies reported marked improvements in balance, including gait and performance-based measures such as the Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) scale and the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test. Programs that incorporated aerobic exercise, dual-task training, and lower limb strengthening were particularly effective. Notably, even interventions lacking explicit cognitive components resulted in improvements in cognitive function, including executive functioning and global cognition. Functional outcomes, such as muscle strength, mobility, fall risk, and fear of falling, also showed consistent improvements. A systematic risk of bias assessment was conducted, with most studies demonstrating acceptable methodological quality; any disagreements were resolved by a third reviewer, enhancing the reliability of our findings. These results underscore the importance of individualized, multifaceted balance training programs in addressing the complex needs of older adults with cognitive impairment, ultimately supporting their quality of life and functional independence.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/173", "#/texts/174", "#/texts/175", "#/texts/177"], "page_nos": [1], "uuid": "a7e10ceb-00c4-440c-ab57-3b246ddfc6a9"}
