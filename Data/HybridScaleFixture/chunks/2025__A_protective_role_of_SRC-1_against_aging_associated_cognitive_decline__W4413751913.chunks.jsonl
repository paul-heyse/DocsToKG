We tested cognitive behaviors in SRC-1-KO mice and mice with a humanized SRC-1 mutation (SRC-1\nL1376P\n), and performed promoter luciferase assays on S100A6.\nResults: Loss of SRC-1 caused alterations in gene signatures that are commonly associated with neurodegenerative diseases, including AD, and diminished the neural plasticity of the hippocampal CA1 neurons. Both SRC-1-KO and SRC-1\nL1376P\nmice displayed early signs of contextual memory impairment at 6 months of age. Mechanistically, SRC-1 significantly promoted the expression S100A6.\nConclusion: We identified a protective role of SRC1 against aging associated cognitive decline, potentially by promoting the expression of S100A6.\n\nA protective role of SRC-1 against aging associated cognitive decline\nIntroduction\nAbout 36% of the elderly population (at an age of 70-75) experience mild memory loss, and about 32% are affected by Alzheimer's disease (AD) [\n1\n]. Owing to the aging of populations worldwide, dementia is reaching epidemic proportions, with a large human, social and economic burden. AD is the most common cause of severe memory loss in the elderly. Despite the tremendous efforts in the field of cognitive regulation, the pathophysiology underlying memory decline is not fully understood, and effective treatments are limited.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/61", "#/texts/62", "#/texts/63", "#/texts/64", "#/texts/65", "#/texts/66", "#/texts/67", "#/texts/68", "#/texts/70", "#/texts/71", "#/texts/72"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "e6d8905f-5a07-454e-9dc1-00a8640bf207"}

The brain is rich in various nuclear receptors and transcription factors that play a crucial role in maintaining metabolic equilibrium and cognitive functions. Notably, thyroid hormone receptor [\n7\n], glucocorticoid receptor [\n8\n], estrogen receptor [\n9\n], peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma [\n10\n], signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 [\n11\n], and Forkhead Box O1 [\n12\n], etc. are among those implicated in both metabolic and Alzheimer's diseases progression. These nuclear receptors and transcription factors depend on coactivators like steroid receptor coactivator-1, 2 and 3 (SRC-1, 2 and 3) [\n13\n] for their transcriptional activities. SRC proteins are prevalent in the brain, especially in areas like the hippocampus and hypothalamus [\n14\n,\n15\n]. Studies have shown that the deletion of SRC-1 (encoded by\nNcoa1\n) gene globally or from the hypothalamus in mice leads to obesity [\n16\n,\n17\n]. A particular gene variant, SRC-1\nL1376P\nmutation, has been linked to early-onset obesity in children (body mass index standard deviation score (BMI SDS) &gt;3.5; age of onset\n17\n,\n18\n]. Despite that loss of SRC-1 does not accelerate the development of AD [\n19\n], another study showed that RNAi-mediated knockdown of SRC-1 in the hippocampal CA1 impairs memory [\n20\n,\n21\n]. Thus, the dysfunction of SRC-1 is linked to both obesity and memory loss.

Based on the high expression of SRC-1 in the cognition center, hippocampus CA1 neurons, we further determined whether SRC-1 regulates S100A6 and S100A11 in the hippocampus, too. S100A6 was significantly decreased (\nFigure 6B\n), and S100A11 displayed a decrease trend (Supplementary\nFigure 5B\n), in the hippocampus of SRC-1-KO mice.
