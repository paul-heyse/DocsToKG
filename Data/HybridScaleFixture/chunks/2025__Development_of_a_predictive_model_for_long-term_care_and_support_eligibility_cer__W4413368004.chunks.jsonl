This study aimed to develop and validate risk prediction models for dementia-related functional impairments using data from the Integrated Research Initiative for Living Well with Dementia Cohort Study (IRIDE-CS), integrating multiple cohort studies conducted in urban Japan.\nAbstractSection Methods\nData, including participant characteristics and dementia-related functional impairments, were collected from 3678 participants in the IRIDE-CS aged 65 and older. These data were separated into a derivation set (\nn\n=\u20092764) and a validation set (\nn\n=\u2009914) for model development and validation, based on the independent cohorts that constitute the IRIDE-CS. Dementia-related functional impairments was defined as the first certification of cognitive impairment at Level I or higher in the LTCI system, with follow-up from April 2018 to August 2023. Two models were developed: Model 1, focused on dementia-related functional impairments factors in Japan, whereas Model 2, prioritized social implementation by limiting predictors to self-reportable items. The predictive performance of each model was evaluated using the concordance index (C-index).\nAbstractSection Results\nDuring follow-up, dementia-related functional impairments occurred in 16.9% of the derivation set and 16.3% of the validation set. Model 1, which included eight predictors (age, history of stroke, visual impairment, hearing impairment, exercise habits, gait speed, grip strength, and albumin), achieved a C-index of 0.75 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.73-0.77) in the derivation dataset and 0.78 (95% CI: 0.74-0.82) in the validation dataset. Model 2, which included six predictors (age, history of stroke, history of heart disease, visual impairment, hearing impairment, and exercise habits), achieved a C-index of 0.73 (95% CI: 0.70-0.75) in the derivation dataset and 0.77 (95% CI: 0.73-0.81) in the validation dataset.\nAbstractSection Conclusions", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/49", "#/texts/50", "#/texts/51", "#/texts/52", "#/texts/53", "#/texts/54", "#/texts/55", "#/texts/56", "#/texts/57", "#/texts/58", "#/texts/59"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "02d7796e-fdf9-4e34-97c1-99bef61d1ed5"}

Further studies are needed to assess the applicability of these models in non-urban areas and middle-aged populations to enhance generalizability.\nPeer Review reports\n\nDevelopment of a predictive model for long-term care and support eligibility certification associated with dementia-related functional impairments: the IRIDE cohort study\nBackground\nEstimates in 2019 revealed that approximately 57 million older adults worldwide were living with dementia; this number is projected to rise to approximately 152 million by 2050 [\n1\n]. The global cost of dementia was 1.3 trillion USD in 2019, with current projections estimating an increase to 2.8 trillion USD by 2030, caused predominantly by increasing caregiving costs [\n2\n]. Therefore, the importance of preventive efforts to delay the onset of dementia, as a key strategy in dementia countermeasures, has recently been highlighted. Identifying individuals at high risk of dementia would enable more efficient implementation of currently available preventive measures.\nA substantial body of research has identified factors associated with the onset of dementia, including sex [\n3\n,\n4\n], years of education [\n5\n], living alone [\n6\n], and a medical history of specific conditions, including hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, stroke, and heart failure [\n7\n,\n8\n,\n9\n,\n10\n,\n11\n]. Physical characteristics, such as low body mass index (BMI) [\n12\n,\n13\n], slow gait speed [\n14\n,\n15\n], reduced grip strength [\n14\n,\n16\n], and fewer remaining teeth [\n17\n,\n18\n], have also been identified as important contributing factors. Furthermore, adopting healthy lifestyle habits is associated with a reduced risk of dementia [\n19\n].", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/60", "#/texts/61", "#/texts/63", "#/texts/64", "#/texts/65", "#/texts/66", "#/texts/67", "#/texts/68", "#/texts/69", "#/texts/70", "#/texts/71", "#/texts/72", "#/texts/73", "#/texts/74", "#/texts/75", "#/texts/76", "#/texts/77", "#/texts/78", "#/texts/79", "#/texts/80", "#/texts/81", "#/texts/82", "#/texts/83", "#/texts/84", "#/texts/85", "#/texts/86", "#/texts/87", "#/texts/88", "#/texts/89", "#/texts/90", "#/texts/91", "#/texts/92", "#/texts/93", "#/texts/94", "#/texts/95", "#/texts/96", "#/texts/97", "#/texts/98", "#/texts/99", "#/texts/100", "#/texts/101", "#/texts/102", "#/texts/103", "#/texts/104"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "f84e1294-098b-4787-92c5-1a881ed9a4f3"}

Representative models include the Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging, and Incidence of Dementia (CAIDE) [\n20\n], which predicts the risk of developing dementia approximately 20 years later using midlife vascular risk factors such as age, years of education, sex, blood pressure, BMI, total cholesterol levels, physical activity, and smoking habits. Another example is the Australian National University Alzheimer's Disease Risk Index (ANU-ADRI) [\n21\n], which is based on self-reported data, incorporating 11 risk factors (e.g., age, sex, low educational attainment, diabetes, traumatic brain injury, depressive symptoms, smoking, and limited social networks) and four protective factors (cognitive stimulation activities, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and fish intake). Additionally, the Lifestyle for Brain Health (LIBRA) emphasizes modifiable midlife risk factors, including depression, hypertension, obesity, smoking, high cholesterol, diabetes, physical inactivity, coronary artery disease, alcohol consumption, and kidney disease [\n22\n]. Although slight differences are observed in the factors included in these risk assessment models, many share a common focus on vascular health indicators, such as hypertension, high cholesterol, and diabetes; physical factors such as BMI; and lifestyle-related factors including physical activity, smoking, and alcohol consumption.\nAssessing future dementia risk may facilitate early preventive interventions against dementia onset. However, research on predictive models for dementia risk remains insufficient in the Asian region, and further investigation is needed to determine whether the variables used in existing models contribute similarly to prediction across different cultural backgrounds. Additionally, developing predictive models that consider not only the risk of dementia onset but also the degree of independence in daily life may contribute to more practical and early-stage dementia prevention strategies.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/105", "#/texts/106", "#/texts/107", "#/texts/108", "#/texts/109", "#/texts/110", "#/texts/111", "#/texts/112"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "02f24e99-3ffb-4648-a7ba-f38c5c07b8fa"}

As one of Japan's national insurance systems, the LTCI is available to all individuals aged 65 and older who require care. Applicants must apply for LTCI services with their local municipal government, after which a care manager assesses their level of care needs. The municipality subsequently grants a care certification based on this assessment. Care certification is classified into seven levels, reflecting the degree of support required: Support Levels 1 and 2, and Care Levels 1 to 5. These levels range from a minimal level of assistance (Support Level 1) to a stage requiring constant care for all activities of daily living (Care Level 5).\nThe LTCI system evaluates the level of care certification and the grade of cognitive disability, which reflects the degree of independence in daily life. The levels include\"Independent\"as well as the following classifications: Level I (having some degree of dementia but being almost independent in daily life, at home and socially), Level IIa/IIb (experiencing some symptoms, behaviors, or communication difficulties that interfere with daily life but maintaining independence with supervision), Level IIIa/IIIb (exhibiting symptoms, behaviors, or communication difficulties that interfere with daily life and requiring care), Level IV (frequently experiencing symptoms, behaviors, or communication difficulties that interfere with daily life and requiring constant care), and Level M (requiring specialized medical care owing to severe psychiatric symptoms, behavioral problems, or serious physical illness).", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/137", "#/texts/138", "#/texts/139", "#/texts/140"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "28748e42-60ab-4bd0-9547-065eceeb0e86"}

To identify earlier stages of dementia-related functional impairments, we defined the impairments as the first time an individual was certified at Level I or higher in the cognitive disability grading system, which has been reported to have a sensitivity of 65% and a specificity of 93% for detecting dementia diagnosed by neuropsychiatrists [\n26\n]. This grading system reflects the degree of daily functional independence in older adults with dementia symptoms and can therefore be considered a proxy indicator of dementia-related disability. Its focus on cognitive symptoms helps minimize the inclusion of functional impairments caused by other conditions.\u3000The long-term care certification data from Itabashi City, Tokyo, were available from April 2018 to August 2023. Therefore, for data before April 2018, we verified through subsequent follow-up surveys of each cohort that participants had no history of dementia and were not taking dementia medication. This helped confirm, as much as possible, that dementia onset had not occurred before the certification period.\nSurvival time was defined as the number of days from participation in the health survey to the development of an event (dementia-related functional impairments) or censoring, including cases of relocation, death, or other reasons. Participants were censored at events such as death or relocation if these occurred during the follow-up period.

To evaluate the model's generalization performance, the dataset was categorized into derivation and validation datasets. The derivation dataset included data from the Takashimadaira study, the Otassha study 2017, and the Otassha study 2019, whereas the validation dataset included data from the Otassha study 2011. The Otassha study 2011 was selected as the validation dataset because it included participants aged 65 to 84 years, representing a broader and more diverse age range compared to the other cohorts (see [\n24\n] for details on each cohort). We considered this cohort appropriate for evaluating the generalizability of the model under conditions approximating external validation. The model was developed using the derivation dataset, and its generalization performance was assessed by comparing the predicted and observed survival times in the validation dataset (details provided below).

The C-index was used to measure the sensitivity and specificity of variables in the model, where values of 1.00 and 0.50 indicate perfect prediction and prediction no better than random chance, respectively [\n30\n]. Although no definitive threshold has been established for the C-index, reference values from existing dementia risk prediction models indicate that CAIDE reported a C-index of 0.60 for predicting dementia onset in older adults aged 65 and above, whereas ANU-ADRI reported a C-index of 0.74 [\n31\n]. To further assess the discriminatory capacity of each model in a clinically interpretable manner, individual risk scores were calculated from the linear predictors of the Cox model. Participants were then categorized into quartile groups (Q1-Q4) based on these scores.

Model 1 incorporated a wide range of physiological and physical indicators, focusing on identifying factors associated with dementia-related functional impairments in Japan. Model 2 was designed to prioritize social implementation by limiting variables to self-assessable items.\nIn Model 1, eight variables were identified as predictors: age, history of stroke, visual impairment, hearing impairment, exercise habits, gait speed, grip strength, and albumin levels. In Model 2, six variables were identified as predictors of dementia dementia-related functional impairments: age, history of stroke, history of heart disease, visual impairment, hearing impairment, and exercise habits. Although both models shared many common variables, Model 1 demonstrated higher predictive performance than Model 2. This may be attributed to the inclusion of gait speed, grip strength, and albumin levels, which are indicators of physical function and blood biomarkers. The variables age, history of stroke, visual impairment, hearing impairment, and exercise habits, which were selected in both models, have been reported in previous studies as being associated with dementia risk, reinforcing the validity of our model selection.

These variables are linked to stroke history [\n38\n,\n39\n,\n40\n] and may have been indirectly reflected through cerebrovascular risk factors. In the validation dataset, the C-index values were 0.77 for Model 1 and 0.78 for Model 2. The ANU-ADRI model has been reported to have a C-index of 0.74 [\n31\n] for cohorts aged 65 and older, suggesting that our model demonstrates a predictive accuracy comparable to previously developed risk models for older adults aged 65 and above. Furthermore, in both models, when participants were stratified into quartiles based on their estimated risk scores, the hazard ratios increased progressively across quartiles, with the highest-risk group (Q4) exhibiting a markedly elevated risk compared to the lowest-risk group (Q1). These clear gradients in hazard across quartiles support the predictive validity of both models in identifying individuals at higher risk for dementia-related functional impairments.\nIn both models of this study, sex was not selected as a predictor. A notable characteristic of the derivation dataset is that, despite previous studies indicating a higher risk of dementia onset in women, the incidence of daily functional impairments associated with dementia was higher in men. This study did not limit its scope to specific underlying diseases but also focused on cognitive impairment's impact on daily functional abilities. As a result, the dataset may have included a higher proportion of cases of vascular dementia, which is known to have a pronounced impact on daily life. Vascular dementia is reported to be more prevalent in men [\n4\n], which may explain the higher incidence of dementia among men in our study. Furthermore, the exclusion of sex as a significant predictor in the models may be attributed to the imbalance in sample size between sexes and/or the emphasis on daily functional impairments.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/263", "#/texts/264", "#/texts/265", "#/texts/266", "#/texts/267", "#/texts/268", "#/texts/269", "#/texts/270", "#/texts/271", "#/texts/272", "#/texts/273", "#/texts/274"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "af95f6ae-8ad3-45a7-b27c-99b59f0f78ce"}

However, directly applying the hazard ratio coefficients from the model for risk prediction requires complex calculations. Therefore, instead of being used as a paper-based checklist, it would be more practical to integrate the model into a computer-based system capable of automatically calculating risk scores. As of 2023, approximately 70% of Japanese households with adults aged 65 and older own a smartphone [\n41\n].

The dataset used in this study was constructed based on data from older adults residing in urban areas of Japan, where living environments, including transportation options, housing conditions, and social support systems, are relatively uniform. This study defined an outcome that considers the impact of cognitive impairment on daily life, making the dataset suitable for this purpose. Additionally, considering that approximately half of Japan's older adult population resides in prefectures classified as major urban areas [\n42\n], this model can be considered relatively representative of the Japanese older population. However, as living environments in non-urban areas differ significantly, careful consideration is required when generalizing this model. To address this limitation, future research should examine the applicability of this model in predicting dementia-related functional impairments in non-urban areas, where cognitive impairment risk factors may differ. Furthermore, this study focused on older adults aged 65 and older, and its applicability to middle-aged populations (under 65) has not been examined. Since the impact of aging-related risk factors may vary across age groups, future research should assess this model's applicability to middle-aged populations and evaluate its generalizability. Another limitation is that detailed information on the severity of underlying diseases (e.g., stroke, heart disease) was not available. These variables were incorporated into the model only as binary self-reported items indicating the presence or absence of each condition. Although this approach allows for simple and scalable data collection in population-based studies, it may limit the model's capacity to capture variations in risk associated with disease severity. Finally, the sex distribution in the derivation dataset was imbalanced, with a higher proportion of women. Although sex was not selected as a significant predictor in the final models, this imbalance may have influenced the process of variable selection and risk estimation. Therefore, the sex disparity in the analytic sample should be considered a limitation, and future studies should aim for a more balanced representation to examine potential sex-specific risk patterns.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/278", "#/texts/279", "#/texts/280"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "db46c4b0-366a-4d64-8c71-8b962fa38452"}
