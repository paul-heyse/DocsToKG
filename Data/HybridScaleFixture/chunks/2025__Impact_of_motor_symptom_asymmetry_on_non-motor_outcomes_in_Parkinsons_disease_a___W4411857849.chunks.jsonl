This systematic review of 80 studies explored how lateralized motor symptoms affect non-motor outcomes in PD, including cognition, emotion, and psychiatric health. Patients with right-sided motor symptoms (left-hemisphere pathology) show more global cognitive decline and higher dementia risk, while those with left-sided symptoms (right-hemisphere pathology) more often experience psychiatric issues like depression, anxiety, and impaired emotional recognition. Visuospatial deficits were consistently linked to left-sided symptoms, aligning with right-hemisphere dysfunction. Although findings vary across studies, this pattern suggests the relevance of brain lateralization in non-motor symptom assessment. Motor asymmetry may also affect treatment responses, such as deep brain stimulation outcomes. However, inconsistencies in study methods-definitions of asymmetry, motor subtypes, and comorbidities-limit meta-analytic conclusions. Overall, incorporating motor symptom asymmetry into PD diagnosis and treatment could enhance personalized care, warranting more standardized future research.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/45"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "5e11ccda-5379-43d4-8fe4-1cfd4362fd04"}

These asymmetries are generally associated with contralateral neurodegenerative patterns at the level of the basal ganglia (BG), measured through different imaging methods, in particular PET and DAT-SCAN\n2\n,\n3\n, but are less obvious using MRI\n4\n. Current literature lacks consensus regarding the underlying causes of motor symptom asymmetry in Parkinson's disease (PD), with various hypotheses proposed. These include histopathological mechanisms, genetic predispositions, motor practice, handedness, and the presence of structural lesions\n5\n. Moreover, the developmental trajectories of motor symptom (a)symmetry seem unclear, with some authors suggesting a persistence of asymmetry of motor symptoms over time, while others suggest a bilateralization of motor symptoms\n6\n,\n7\n,\n8\n.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/48", "#/texts/49", "#/texts/50", "#/texts/52", "#/texts/53", "#/texts/54", "#/texts/56", "#/texts/57", "#/texts/58", "#/texts/60", "#/texts/61", "#/texts/62", "#/texts/63", "#/texts/64", "#/texts/65", "#/texts/66", "#/texts/67", "#/texts/68", "#/texts/69", "#/texts/70", "#/texts/71", "#/texts/72", "#/texts/73", "#/texts/74", "#/texts/75", "#/texts/76"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "2383f7ef-c834-4815-8561-ea6afdc13082"}

Accordingly, the first so-called \"Brain-first\" phenotype would be characterized by disease development in subcortical regions, in particular in the olfactory bulb or amygdala, associated symptomatically to the presence of fewer autonomic symptoms, less Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep disorders, less hyposmia, as well as slower disease progression and cognitive decline; this phenotype is suggested to be more associated with lateralized motor symptoms and asymmetric dopaminergic denervation. The second phenotype, named \"Body-first PD\", characterized by pathologic processes in the enteric nervous system, would be symptomatically characterized by greater autonomic symptoms, more rapid disease progression, and cognitive decline. This latter phenotype would be more associated with symmetrical motor symptoms and equally symmetrical dopaminergic denervation\n11\n,\n12\n. A recent post-mortem study suggested a revision of the dual-hit SOC model, in particular, the Body-first phenotype (with a symmetrical onset of disease) would be more inclined to develop dementias, especially dementia with Lewy bodies\n13\n,\n14\n. Accordingly, and therefore, links are starting to be established between (a-)symmetry of motor symptoms and major cognitive impairments in PD. One of the limitations of the SOC model is that it does not specify if different expected profiles exist based on whether the disease begins on the left or right hemi-body, as well as on the spreading of pathology from one hemisphere to the other, inducing a bilateralization of the disease as described by Hobson\n1\n. Yet, studies in various neurodegenerative pathologies, but also healthy controls (HC), have consistently pointed to a greater vulnerability of the left hemisphere for neurodegenerative processes, supported by clinical, imaging, and pathogenetic evidence of cognitive decline\n15\n.

Results revealed differential effects of DBS depending on the asymmetry of motor symptoms. Performance for executive functions was largely preserved in RPD patients, compared to the control group, at 3 months and 12 months post-DBS, with the exception of scores on the verbal executive task, where performance declined at 12 months post-DBS. On the other hand, the performance of LPD patients deteriorated post-operatively on nonverbal executive functions and on global cognitive efficiency, compared to the control group.

In contrast, patients with right-predominant motor symptoms (RPD), reflecting left-hemisphere pathology, show a greater propensity for global cognitive decline, particularly in memory and executive functions, which may increase their risk of developing dementia over time. These lateralized patterns underscore the importance of considering hemispheric involvement when assessing non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease\n19\n,\n20\n.\nAsymmetry in motor symptoms not only influences the progression of PD but also interacts with therapies like DRT and DBS.

Another, non-mutually exclusive, hypothesis posits that the presence of bilateral motor symptoms may also act as a risk factor for cognitive deterioration\n10\n,\n14\n,\n110\n, without necessarily contradicting the specific contribution of left hemispheric vulnerability.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/573", "#/texts/574", "#/texts/575", "#/texts/576", "#/texts/577", "#/texts/578", "#/texts/579", "#/texts/580", "#/texts/581", "#/texts/582", "#/texts/583", "#/texts/584", "#/texts/585", "#/texts/586", "#/texts/587", "#/texts/588", "#/texts/589", "#/texts/590", "#/texts/591", "#/texts/592", "#/texts/593", "#/texts/594", "#/texts/595", "#/texts/596", "#/texts/597", "#/texts/598", "#/texts/599", "#/texts/600", "#/texts/601"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "cf171199-bb83-4eae-b315-d7e1481e084b"}

The findings suggest that the effects of STN-DBS on neuropsychological performance, psychiatric symptoms, and emotional processing vary based on motor symptom asymmetry\n20\n,\n39\n,\n52\n. Past studies on unilateral DBS may provide insights into these observations, revealing improved outcomes in the more affected hemisphere\n71\n. For instance, Hershey et al.\n71\nfound that unilateral stimulation of the most affected brain region yielded significant effects on working memory tasks, particularly for LPD patients, suggesting greater right hemisphere involvement. Similar findings regarding DRT indicate that LPD patients often show more significant improvements in cognitive functions compared to RPD patients\n46\n. This underscores the need for nuanced approaches to therapy based on the asymmetry of motor symptoms. However, this area of research remains in its infancy, necessitating further validation through longitudinal studies with larger cohorts.\nTo integrate the observed differences into a cohesive framework, we propose a theoretical model outlining the evolution of cognitive, psychiatric, and emotional symptoms based on motor symptom asymmetry (see Fig.\n2\n). This model visually synthesizes current evidence and illustrates two distinct trajectories emerging from the asymmetrical onset of motor symptoms. It also includes a schematic representation of cognitive symptom progression over time, highlighting the differing risks and profiles associated with right-versus left-sided motor onset. Importantly, the model emphasizes underexplored aspects, such as the role and evolution of symptomatology in patients with symmetrical motor presentations. By offering a comprehensive, asymmetry-informed perspective, this model complements traditional motor-focused frameworks and supports the development of more personalized clinical care strategies.\nFig. 2", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/602", "#/texts/603", "#/texts/604", "#/texts/605", "#/texts/606", "#/texts/607", "#/texts/608", "#/texts/609", "#/texts/610", "#/texts/611", "#/texts/612", "#/texts/613", "#/texts/614", "#/texts/615", "#/texts/616", "#/texts/617", "#/texts/618"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "bd5b6b11-d81e-490b-8649-7b1bcb34ea06"}

A lack of longitudinal evaluations, as well as epidemiological naturalistic follow-up (e.g., studies evaluating the evolution of symptoms, without exclusion/inclusion criteria's), further complicates our understanding of the relationship between non-motor symptoms and motor (a)symmetry. While motor symptom asymmetry likely contributes to performance variability, additional factors like gender may also play a crucial role in the manifestation of non-motor symptoms in PD\n17\n,\n111\n,\n112\n. In addition, although we analyzed cognitive, psychiatric, and emotional symptoms separately, it is not possible to rule out potential interactions among them, interactions that may reveal a much more complex clinical picture. While some of the referenced studies report elevated levels of depression and anxiety in patient populations, they often lack detailed information on medication use, which limits our ability to assess its impact on cognitive outcomes. Future research would benefit from incorporating standardized assessments of mood symptoms and medication to better disentangle the respective contributions of depression and neurodegenerative processes to cognitive decline.\nTo conclude, from diagnosis and possibly even in the prodromal phase, two distinct cognitive, psychiatric, and emotional trajectories are observed based on motor symptom asymmetry in PD, potentially affecting patients' daily quality of life. Patients with predominantly right motor symptoms (left brain alteration) tend to develop cognitive-apathetic non-motor symptoms and are at higher risk of long-term dementia. Conversely, patients with left motor symptoms (right brain alteration) are more likely to experience anxio-depressive symptoms, visuo-spatial disorders, and have a lower risk of developing dementia over time. These divergent profiles suggest a need to move beyond motor symptom classifications alone and consider asymmetry when tailoring interventions. Although the proposed model offers a promising structure for this purpose, further empirical validation is needed to refine and generalize its clinical relevance.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/619", "#/texts/620", "#/texts/621", "#/texts/622", "#/texts/623", "#/texts/624", "#/texts/625", "#/texts/626"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "a8989213-662a-462a-8eaa-8a14f7f4925f"}
