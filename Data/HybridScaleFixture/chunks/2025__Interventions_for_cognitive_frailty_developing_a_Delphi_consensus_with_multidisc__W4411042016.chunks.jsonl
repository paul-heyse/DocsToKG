Indications that CF is potentially reversible have led to proposals that risk factors, symptoms or mechanisms of CF would be appropriate targets for interventions for prevention, delay or reversal. However, no study has brought experts together across sectors to determine targets, content or mode of interventions, and most resources on interventions are from the perspective of academic or clinical researchers only. This international Delphi consensus study brings together experts from academic and clinical research, lay people with lived experience of CF, informal carers, and professional care practitioners/clinicians.\nMethods:\nThree rounds of Delphi study were held to discern which factors and statements were agreed upon by the whole sample and which generated different views in those with differing expertise. A scoping review and Round 1 (29 participants) were used to gather initial statements. In Round 2, 58 people responded to statements and open text items, comprising 7 lab-based researchers, 27 researchers working with people, 14 people with lived experience or informal family carers, and 10 professional carers/clinicians. Percent agreement and qualitative responses were analyzed to provide a final set of statements which were checked by 38 respondents in Round 3.\nResults:\nAnalysis of Round 2 quantitative data provided 74 statements on which there was at least 70% agreement and qualitative data produced a further 24 statements. These were combined to provide 90 statements for Round 3. There was Consensus for 89 of the statements. A few differences between the groups were observed at both stages.\nDiscussion and conclusion:\nThe consensus for statements associated with CF interventions provides a useful first step in defining health promotion activities and interventions. Given the prevalence and potential disability caused by CF in older populations, the consensus statements represent expert opinion that is inter-sectoral and will inform public health policies to support implementation of evidence-based prevention and intervention plans. This study is an important step toward changing current approaches, by including all stakeholders from the outset. Outcomes can be used to feed into co-creation of interventions for cognitive frailty.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/244", "#/texts/245", "#/texts/246", "#/texts/247", "#/texts/248", "#/texts/249", "#/texts/250", "#/texts/251"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "ecbdab54-d8b2-4998-bacf-65548b07ee24"}

Research on CF is growing, indicating, for example, that distinguishing the cognitive impairments and any neuropathological changes shown in CF from neurodegeneration associated with early dementia is essential (\nBunce et al., 2019\n;\nFa\u00e7al et al., 2019\n). This is important because CF is described as a state in which there is an increased risk for eventual dementia and loss of independent function, but also because it has been described as reversible, or potentially reversible (\nRuan et al., 2020\n;\nRuan et al., 2015\n). In the current absence of a cure for dementia, increasing prevention efforts is essential. That CF is a potentially reversible syndrome has led to the proposal that addressing risk factors, symptoms or mechanisms of either cognitive impairment or physical frailty, or importantly, the mechanisms associated with the link between the two, would be appropriate targets for intervention to prevent, delay or reverse it (see also\nHolland et al., 2024\n). Importantly, this highlights CF not just as a problem that may grow with increasing older populations, but as an important opportunity for healthy aging. However, despite the development of our understanding, CF remains poorly addressed as a target for intervention and perhaps poorly understood amongst the range of people with different kinds of expertise and experience in this area.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/253", "#/texts/254", "#/texts/255", "#/texts/256", "#/texts/257", "#/texts/258", "#/texts/259", "#/texts/260", "#/texts/261", "#/texts/262", "#/texts/263", "#/texts/264", "#/texts/265"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "0b992ea1-23b1-41c9-89b0-b8cf25a6c0a7"}

Both definitions relate to a recognized syndrome characterized as a state of increased vulnerability to adverse health outcomes when exposed to a stressor (\nClegg et al., 2013\n). Underlying biological changes influence homeostatic mechanisms and absence of physiological resilience, including muscle wasting, metabolic deficits, cardiovascular disease, inflammatory symptoms and oxidative stress. The presence of both cognitive impairment and physical frailty may exacerbate vulnerability to adverse health outcomes, underscoring the need for integrated interventions targeting the unique mechanisms of cognitive frailty,\nCognitive Impairment No Dementia (CIND), the level of cognitive impairment at the focus of CF, has been defined in various ways, but the 2013 consensus exercise (\nKelaiditi et al., 2013\n) suggested a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) of 0.5 (equivalent to \"very mild\" observed impairment). Other literature has emphasized an equivalence with the Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) range on global tests of cognition such as the Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE;\nFolstein et al., 1975\n) or Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA,\nNasreddine et al., 2005\n), or a combination of tests of specific cognitive domains such as verbal memory or executive function e.g., (see\nFa\u00e7al et al. (2019)\nfor a review) and others have emphasized subjective cognitive decline, particularly for a reversible level of CF (\nRuan et al., 2015\n).

To date and to our knowledge, there are no agreed pathways for intervention for CF. Several reviews have been published examining interventions for CF, focusing on different mixes of intervention targets: physical exercise interventions (\nLi et al., 2022\n); a mixture of cognitive training, nutrition education, behavioral intervention, mind-body intervention, psychosocial support, and virtual reality but all with a component of physical activity (\nTam et al., 2022\n); physical activity, nutrition or multidomain interventions (\nZheng et al., 2022\n); nutrition only, with a focus on anti-oxidants (\nGomez-Gomez and Zapico, 2019\n); and multidimensional and potentially personalized interventions (\nSugimoto et al., 2022\n).

(1975)\ndescribed the different potential objectives of a Delphi process which include: exploring or exposing underlying assumptions or information that may lead to different judgments; seeking information that may generate consensus amongst participants; and finding linkages between different judgments in a topic that spans a range of disciplines. Delphi techniques are considered to provide the lowest level of evidence for making causal inferences, i.e., subordinate to meta-analyses and intervention studies (\nLiu, 2022\n) but are appropriate particularly for consumer review in guideline development and in relation to complex issues where knowledge is uncertain (\nLinstone and Turoff, 2002\n). Importantly, the process is iterative in which a series of questionnaires can be used so that each member can contribute independently, and anonymously, and each round is a controlled feedback process of the information gained in the previous round, reducing the possibility of bias or undue influence of some experts, especially where there is a perceived power imbalance.\nMethodological sources suggest that a mix of experts provides clearer face validity for any consensus achieved (e.g.,\nNair et al., 2011\n), particularly where the motivation of end users may be a key component of potential outcomes - the interventions in this case. This mix of experts was chosen to ensure that consensus on what might work in terms of scientific evidence was combined with what might work for people who may be the recipients, beneficiaries and those who may deliver the interventions.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/299", "#/texts/300", "#/texts/301", "#/texts/302", "#/texts/303", "#/texts/304", "#/texts/305", "#/texts/306", "#/texts/307", "#/texts/308", "#/texts/309", "#/texts/310"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "506754ea-4d78-4684-afdc-5c20cd7fd861"}

Nevertheless, it was also recognized that understanding in some areas, notably biological, pharmacological, medical and neuroscience mechanisms, may be less well-developed within the range of experts included. Therefore, in addition to seeking overall consensus across the participants as in a traditional Delphi study, we also aimed to determine whether there were any significant differences between the different groups of participants.\nThus, the aims of this Delphi study were to:\ni. Develop consensus among experts across disciplines and sectors, including people with lived experience, in relation to understanding of cognitive frailty and appropriate interventions for it.\nii. Examine differences in consensus between groups with different disciplinary backgrounds and lived experience.\n\nInterventions for cognitive frailty: developing a Delphi consensus with multidisciplinary and multisectoral experts\nMethods\nThe process included three rounds to achieve expert consensus on sub-components of interventions, as follows:\n\u2022 Understanding of what CF is, whether it is preventable, could be delayed, or could be reversible;\n\u2022 possible mechanisms or approaches for interventions, and target foci for interventions;\n\u2022 any restrictions on for whom interventions for CF may or may not be relevant;\n\u2022 screening for CF;\n\u2022 factors that may affect the feasibility or likelihood of adherence to interventions, including effects of infrastructure, accessibility or personal circumstances on feasibility of interventions;\n\u2022 potential targeted primary and secondary outcomes;\n\u2022 factors in the design of interventions that may influence effectiveness;\n\u2022 and any other design factors.\nFollowing an initial literature search activity as part of a scoping review, (\nHolland et al., 2024\n), three Delphi rounds were held. Ethical approval was granted in advance by Lancaster University Faculty of Health and Medicine Ethical Committee (REF FHM-2022-1092-RECR-1) and updated using amendments as the survey was developed for each round (FHM-2023-1092-SA-1).", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/311", "#/texts/312", "#/texts/313", "#/texts/314", "#/texts/315", "#/texts/316", "#/texts/318", "#/texts/319", "#/texts/320", "#/texts/321", "#/texts/322", "#/texts/323", "#/texts/324", "#/texts/325", "#/texts/326", "#/texts/327", "#/texts/328", "#/texts/329"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "0eb07815-5f24-4794-8aa3-927356d2c13e"}

Grouping participants by expertise allowed for an analysis of consensus differences based on professional or personal perspectives, providing insights into how lived experiences and disciplinary backgrounds influence cognitive frailty intervention priorities.

Given the increasing number of older people globally, an increased number of people living with CF is likely, as is the associated risk of disability resulting from this co-existence of physical and cognitive impairments. CF is a potentially preventable risk state for later life consequences such as dementia and increased need for health and social care support and an important target to reduce the gap between healthy lifespan and actual lifespan, that is, healthy aging. It is also a pressing concern given the wide variation in healthcare utilization and opportunities to access and use clinical and rehabilitation services to identify and treat frailty and cognitive decline. An increased awareness of the importance of prevention and building resilience is needed to support mid-life populations to promote or maintain healthy aging in their communities.\nThis Delphi consensus study set out to explore and develop consensus around interventions for CF among experts across disciplines and sectors, including people with lived experience of CF, and those providing care. Views of those in carer roles, unpaid or as part of their employment, were important to include, in relation to their understanding of CF and interventions for it, recognizing sub-clinical functional effects of CF. Given that previous resources and reviews on interventions for CF had largely been from the point of view of applied health researchers or clinicians, this study represents a first attempt to obtain agreement across a broader spectrum of involved experts on critical factors for interventions. The study brought in a broader mix to include the perspectives of people who may be involved in the decisions about which interventions to operationalize with specific patients or population groups, the potential end users and those who care for them, as well as basic laboratory scientists whose perspectives may not often be considered in relation to operationalization or methods of health interventions and who are not often involved in such operationalization or design. These results emphasize the need for tailored interventions that consider both individual and structural determinants of cognitive frailty.

Out of the original 127 items presented to participants in Round 2, there was consensus on 74, and although fuller consensus was achieved in the final round (Round 3), information can also be gathered from some of the items where consensus was not achieved in Round 2. Little consensus was observed in the section on understanding of the concept of CF. Notably, there was a lack of consensus on whether it was a help or a hindrance to normalize CF as an expected part of aging. For some, there is therefore a belief that CF could be a normal part of aging. While physiological changes that occur with increasing age are clearly a risk factor for CF, our own work and that of others (see\nHolland et al., 2024\nfor a review) have identified risk factors that may worsen, and in contrast, factors that reduce, the rate at which age-related biological changes occur. Examples are factors that impact on immune system aging such as stress or diet, or impacts of healthy lifestyle on cardiovascular health. Increasing understanding that some age-related conditions can be prevented, delayed or reversed is a crucial step toward countering beliefs about inevitability. That is, although reviewed evidence shows increase in likelihood of CF with increasing age, evidence also describes it as a distinct, non-universal and mainly pre-clinical condition associated with these risk factors. Nevertheless, given that the respondent group included people with lived experience, we also need to acknowledge that some people were in a situation where accepting the impacts of aging was an important part of their own coping and resilience.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/593", "#/texts/594", "#/texts/595"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "9cc27466-b30e-4d82-b080-03dfb5f4ffc6"}

This a known problem with significant 'self-stigma' and wider societal stigma associating any changes in old age with commonly held beliefs that cognitive decline and frailty are inevitable conditions of older age (\nPreville et al., 2015\n). Linking to the statement on normalizing CF as a normal part of aging being seen as a hindrance, this may be because of the negative attitudes toward aging in general and the consequences this has, i.e., not prioritizing intervention for CF. Given the accurate identification by the World Health Organisation of ageism as one of the four key pillars of the Decade of Healthy Aging (\nWorld Heath Organisation, 2021\n), it is essential to challenge even \"compassionate ageism\" which incorporates stereotypical assumptions that frame mindsets, behaviors and clinical interventions, almost making frailty and cognitive decline a self-fulfilling prophecy. Providing strong evidence to support a more positive aging agenda is crucial and so emphasis on preventative interventions is critical.\nThe laboratory-based scientists' level of consensus diverged from views of those with lived experience and clinicians on some topics, highlighting that the biological science associated with frailty and brain health at a mechanistic level needs to be factored into the consideration of interventions. The interaction between the potential for biological mechanisms and lifestyle, environment or policy interventions is explored further in our scoping reviews (\nFowler Davis et al., 2024a\n;\nFowler Davis et al., 2024b\n;\nHodgson et al., 2024\n;\nHolland et al., 2024\n), and this Delphi study suggests that understanding and knowledge exchange across the disciplines could enhance potential theory-based design of interventions. Likewise, the high consensus associated with \"Many researchers and clinicians are not clear what is meant by cognitive frailty\" suggests that more needs to be done to explain and differentiate CF from purely brain related ill-health including dementias, while still accepting that people with different expertise will bring different perspectives to the mix.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/596", "#/texts/597", "#/texts/598", "#/texts/599", "#/texts/600", "#/texts/601", "#/texts/602", "#/texts/603", "#/texts/604", "#/texts/605", "#/texts/606", "#/texts/607", "#/texts/608", "#/texts/609"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "44bf3d16-1e36-4cef-bc64-25933b39b038"}

However, it is important to note some of the places where there were differences; for example, in Round 3, there was no consensus among respondents with lived experience and carers in terms of items \"Many researchers and clinicians are not clear what is meant by cognitive frailty\" and \"Whilst normal aging may contribute to CF, it is unhelpful to assume that cognitive frailty is an expected part of aging.\" The lack of consensus on the latter statement can be attributed to the conflict between knowledge that certain deficits increase in likelihood with increasing age, versus knowledge that age, per se, does not cause them, rather, that a range of mechanisms that are subject to a range of risk factors and environmental influences affect the variability observed within the older population. A further difference where this group did not show consensus, but the others did, was the item referring to the impact of air pollution on brain health, especially for those with pre-existing vulnerability, leading to cognitive frailty. This is also evidenced in the literature (e.g.,\nPower et al., 2016\n;\nHodgson et al., 2024\n), but may well be an example of more recent evidence that is relatively well-known amongst researchers but not yet in the public domain.\nOther differences between expert groups showed that the Lab scientists (who were all biologists), showed differential consensus on specific items in Round 2. For example, \"The role of the individual is important, rather than just a focus on biological or environmental mechanisms\" showed no consensus for the Lab scientists but consensus for the other groups, and \"Intervening on more direct biological mechanisms may be quicker\" showed consensus for the academic lab-scientists but not for any other group. Bringing together researchers and other experts who emphasize the individual person together with biologists who put more emphasis on the underlying biological mechanism in development of interventions is an important exercise as we seek to put all our expertise together to solve the challenges of aging and have impact beyond what we can at present; this is illustrated by these differences and is a strength of this approach.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/613", "#/texts/614", "#/texts/615", "#/texts/616", "#/texts/617", "#/texts/618"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "f24e2089-7e33-41b6-8bc4-b84eacebb905"}

Given that there is evidence (although limited as yet for reversibility in the literature; e.g.,\nRuan et al., 2020\n), this suggests that more work is needed to engage people with lived experience to promote this possibility, given that if there is little expectation of improvement once CF is present, motivation for intervention may be lower. However, further investigation is needed to understand this group's perspective, ensuring people are distinguishing between dementia and the cognitive decline associated with CF. The consensus on the statement that few intervention studies directly address the reversibility question seems to tally with literature searches and suggests that this is an area where further research is needed. Many interventions have shown reductions in frailty and cognitive impairment (for a recent review, see\nJi et al., 2025\n), but studies on reversibility are not absent, e.g.,\nHuang et al. (2025)\ndemonstrated reversal from Reversible CF (RCF) to non-cognitively frail (non-CF) and from potentially reversible CF (PRCF) status to both RCF and non-CF status in multi-domain interventions. Although statistically significant, the proportion of participants reversing was still small and further research is needed to determine why some people show reversing and others do not. A further study again using a multi-domain intervention (WE-RISE \u2122), found that after 12 weeks, 74% of the intervention group were no longer assessed as having cognitive frailty whereas only 10.7% of the control group were no longer cognitively frail (\nMurukesu et al., 2024\n).

The first few steps align with our progress in this consensus development and the evidence syntheses that preceded it, as we have sought to (1) define and understand the problem and its causes; (2) identify which causal or contextual factors are modifiable including which have the greatest scope for change and who would benefit most; and (3) deciding on the mechanisms of change. The latter three steps of Wight et al. provide suggestions as to what is next which should be considered in further development following this consensus stage: (4) clarifying how interventions will be delivered; (5) testing and adapting the intervention; and (6) collecting sufficient evidence of effectiveness to proceed to a rigorous evaluation.\n1. Define and understand the problem and its causes\nThe primary outcomes of any planned intervention need to address the outcomes identified via the consensus such as cognition and mobility, ensuring understanding of definitions of CF (and so inclusion in interventions). Secondarily, older adults with CF will experience a need for improved independence, quality of life and wellbeing. These broad interventions should be affordable, timely and meaningful (meet personal attitudes and beliefs. About the effectiveness of an intervention). Mobility, affordability, access to screening methods and physically accessible environments and healthy foods were all deemed significant to the cause and effects of CF.\n1. Identify which causal or contextual factors are modifiable including which have the greatest scope for change and who would benefit most\nThere was a strong consensus that CF can be prevented, delayed or reduced, given knowledge on risk factors. Biological mechanisms could be targeted alongside social and psychological factors that involve long-term changes to lifestyle, and these may include environmental exposure. In this respect policy changes are needed to influence psychosocial/socioeconomic factors that disproportionally place some older adults at risk of CF.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/630", "#/texts/631", "#/texts/632", "#/texts/633", "#/texts/634", "#/texts/635", "#/texts/636"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "10656fac-3ea4-4df0-a039-c71546579e9d"}

Risk factors may be individual but also interact in complex ways so require multiple interventions. Early assessment/screening of older people would help identify factors for earlier interventions, rather than only identifying a problem when the individual encounters health care practitioners.\nOverall, there is a belief among some respondents that CF might not be reversible (and the best timing for interventions to enable reversal is not known, possibly because there is limited evidence for reversal in the literature), but it could be improved, although evidence on reversibility is building. Interdisciplinary working to test interventions in different models and systems (including cell culture and animal models from invertebrate to vertebrate) will help to improve likelihood that pre-clinical studies are clinically relevant.\nExperts agreed that effectiveness (how it works in the real world), affordability and acceptability (for example, in terms of time commitment), were important and that interventions should be planned together with the affected person. Intervention acceptability would be based on the early measurement of effect with the option to revise and adjust interventions and to ensure that a maintenance component is included.\n1. Deciding on the mechanisms of change.\nInterventions need to be personally relevant (e.g., acceptable in different cultures) and personalized. Biological or environmental mechanisms may vary, and so intervention goals should target lifestyles to protect individuals from decline. Healthy behaviors including physical activity might be helpful but a focus on multi-domain intervention and common mechanisms such as psychosocial and socioeconomic factors should be emphasized. For those with urgent needs, a fast-acting personalized intervention should be considered but long-term lifestyle modification may also be suitable for different people. Physical activity with diet and probiotics, targeting isolation and loneliness, and strength-related exercise, are all important although with recognition that other morbidities such as arthritis will influence individual ability to complete those. There was consensus that agency and involvement of the person in agreement on choice of interventions was vital. There was also agreement that screening was essential, particularly that high-risk people should first be screened at midlife.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/637", "#/texts/638", "#/texts/639", "#/texts/640", "#/texts/641"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "bc6d73b2-fcc5-4940-893c-d7a5b9755302"}

This is consistent with several trials that demonstrate the effectiveness of multi-domain interventions often delivered as complex interventions for cognitive and physical frailty (\nNg et al., 2015\n;\nDedeyne et al., 2017\n) and for reversion of CF status (\nMurukesu et al., 2024\n).\nThe reversibility of CF is an extremely important differentiating factor for investment in interventions and an outcome measure suggesting treatment effectiveness will be critical for any future trial and research programs. Respondents agreed that improved cognition, improved mobility and reversal to a non-cognitive frailty profile would be the important outcomes to show effectiveness.\nThe dominant narrative within the section on \"Approaches to interventions for cognitive frailty\" suggests that most experts share values around person-centered care and assessment of wellbeing, widely agreeing upon these as critically important. However, this presents a significant challenge to researchers, given that the predicted incidence of CF may be as high as 9% of the older population (\nQiu et al., 2022\n) and a population health approach is needed for both treatment and prevention. Although the role of person-centered or culturally specified interventions was agreed upon as necessary (\"one size does not fit all\"), there is a need for theory-driven, generalizable approaches that can enhance efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and scalability of existing implementation approaches (\nSchleider and Beidas, 2022\n) for CF. Scalable but contextualized interventions seem the way forward.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/642", "#/texts/643", "#/texts/644", "#/texts/645", "#/texts/646", "#/texts/647", "#/texts/648", "#/texts/649", "#/texts/650", "#/texts/651", "#/texts/652", "#/texts/653", "#/texts/654", "#/texts/655", "#/texts/656"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "f9abf8d1-5870-49d8-be73-ca3f637eab7d"}

However, self-selection across a range of disciplines in the CF network is a novel approach, that necessitated a disaggregation of the responses of separate groups, to examine any differences. The number of respondents in total was seen as comparable to other previous Delphi studies (e.g.,\nSezgin et al., 2022\n, had 21 experts), although the small number in some groups in Round 3 (notably laboratory scientists and professional carers/clinicians) is a limitation. The participant group was diverse in terms of geographical spread, including experts from UK, Europe, North and South America, and Asia. From our examinations of the diversity within the CF Interdisciplinary network (CFIN) in which this study was based, we know that we have good diversity of ethnicities. However, despite significant Chinese representation of CF expertise in the literature, we did not have any respondents for that country, and so this could be a limitation. Nevertheless, the approach provides broader face validity to the consensus achieved e.g., (see\nNair et al., 2011\n). We intend that such common shared understanding can underline the roles of all these groups in development of interventions or population-level policy changes to impact the mitigation of CF and healthcare utilization, with an emphasis on prevention of disability, and associated need for care support.\nGiven the focus on interventions, there was no exploration of understanding of the aetiology of CF, and causes of CF were not included in the Delphi. Understanding of mechanisms will be needed to suggest how interventions would target and potentially reverse the progress of the syndrome. Nevertheless, a strength of this study is the clear consensus on lifestyle and behavioral interventions concurring with various previous reviews indicating that the syndrome is affected by personal behavior change. Our previous scoping reviews of mechanisms also suggest that behavior change may be one important factor that links underlying mechanisms to both healthy aging and also outcome CF (although there are other linking variables as well, including depression and anxiety,\nHolland et al., 2024\n) and environmental issues (\nFowler Davis et al., 2024a\n;\nFowler Davis et al., 2024b\n;\nHodgson et al., 2024\n).", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/658", "#/texts/659", "#/texts/660", "#/texts/661", "#/texts/662", "#/texts/663", "#/texts/664", "#/texts/665", "#/texts/666", "#/texts/667", "#/texts/668", "#/texts/669", "#/texts/670", "#/texts/671"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "3ef5de8a-08bc-464f-a41a-a9cb3923842a"}

None-the-less, given the dominance of pharmacological solutions and therapeutic methods, there may be existing or newer pharmacological or nutritional interventions worthy of further investigation for managing brain health, for example Vitamin D as a neuron therapeutic for reducing inflammation (\nMurukesu and Manucha, 2024\n).\nWe did not collect demographic information such as age and ethnicity, although we know that the CFIN network on which this study was based is relatively diverse. However, future work could usefully explore how cultural factors influence both the acceptability and effectiveness of CF interventions.\nThe value of the input of people with different expertise is demonstrated by this study&gt; Although many of the proposed recommendations were based on existing evidence as well as the consensus achieved in this study, they still require validation through experimental studies.\n\nInterventions for cognitive frailty: developing a Delphi consensus with multidisciplinary and multisectoral experts\nConclusion\nThe consensus achieved in this study associated with CF interventions needs to be considered as a first step in defining health promotion activities and interventions. The consensus provides a foundation for policy-guided, preventive approaches. Given the prevalence and resultant potential disability in older adult populations, the consensus statements are important and represent expert opinion that is inter-sectoral. Research in this direction will further inform public health policies to implement evidence-based research findings to the development of prevention plans (\nKelaiditi et al., 2013\n). However, given what we know about the length of the gap between what academic researchers know and actual implementation in healthcare or policy changes (\nMorris et al., 2011\n), or adoption by patients, a new way of planning and promoting the need for prevention and intervention in this area is needed. This study takes a crucial step toward changing current siloed approaches, including all stakeholders from the outset.
