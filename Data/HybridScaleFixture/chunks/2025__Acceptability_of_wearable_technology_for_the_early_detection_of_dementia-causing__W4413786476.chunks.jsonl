Early detection of dementia-causing diseases could support therapeutic intervention to decelerate disease progression. Wearable digital technologies can be used to identify early signs of such diseases and remotely monitor disease progression. However, technologies must be acceptable to users. This study explored the perspectives of participants on the acceptability of various wearable technologies for early detection.\nAbstractSection Method\nParticipants from the Cognitive Decline using Digital Devices (CODEC-II) cohort used four different wearables (smartwatch, electroencephalographic [EEG] headband, active and passive smartphone apps) for two weeks every three months over a year. A subgroup participated in semi structured interviews after two weeks to discuss their experiences and acceptance of the devices. Data was analysed using the framework analysis approach, aided by N-Vivo (v14.23.2).\nAbstractSection Results\nTwenty-one participants were interviewed, including individuals with subjective cognitive decline (\nn\n=\u200910), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (\nn\n=\u20097), dementia with Lewy bodies (\nn\n=\u20091), and three caregivers. Five key themes were identified, including ease of use, wearability, usefulness, transparency, and behavioral intention. Many participants relied on the research team to help set up the technology for them due to high levels of digital anxiety. Individuals with MCI particularly struggled with cognitive testing games in the active smartphone app, which they experienced increased awareness of their own cognitive impairments. Participants preferred wrist-worn over head-worn devices due to familiarity and impact on their appearance. While some participants enjoyed using the wearables, others questioned their accuracy for medical purposes. There was also a lack of understanding around what data were being collected from the wearables and how it was being collected, with some expressing concerns about data disclosure. Participants with professional or caregiving responsibilities described how their busy lifestyles hindered daily use of the wearables.\nAbstractSection Conclusion\nThese findings highlight the importance of using an inclusive design approach to meet users' needs and support digital inclusivity, and an effective communication strategy to increase transparency and reduce data disclosure concerns. Future research is needed to explore the effectiveness of implementing current recommendations to support digital health equity and codesign a communication strategy with users to ensure the information is understandable.\nAbstractSection Trial registration", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/45", "#/texts/46", "#/texts/47", "#/texts/48", "#/texts/49", "#/texts/50", "#/texts/51", "#/texts/52", "#/texts/53", "#/texts/54", "#/texts/55", "#/texts/56", "#/texts/57", "#/texts/58", "#/texts/59"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "561575c9-17c5-444b-b146-12247479e19f"}

[\n1\n] Dementia is a syndrome associated with the deterioration of cognitive function beyond normal aging [\n2\n] and is caused by a variety of different diseases that destroy neurons and damage neurophysiological processes [\n3\n]. The most common type of dementia-causing disease is Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by neuropathologic findings of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary, tau-based tangles [\n4\n]. These features may begin 15 to 20 years before obvious cognitive symptoms [\n5\n]. Detecting dementia-causing disease early could support therapeutic intervention to decelerate disease progression, such as Lecanemab, a pharmacological intervention recently approved for use in the United Kingdom (UK) for the early stages of Alzheimer's disease [\n6\n]. Current dementia diagnostic workup includes a combination of expensive and invasive techniques, including neuroimaging and cerebral spinal fluid analysis, used once symptoms of dementia-causing diseases become clinically apparent [\n7\n,\n8\n].\nResearchers are currently exploring various other methods for detecting subtle changes in cognition, behavior and physiology early, such as the use of blood-based biomarkers (e.g., beta-amyloid) [\n9\n,\n10\n]. These biomarkers have shown promise and could help differentiate between different dementia-causing diseases in the future [\n11\n]. Wearable technologies can also collect data and monitor changes in behavior, such as gait [\n12\n], sleep [\n13\n] and cognition [\n14\n]. These technologies can be worn on the body or attached to clothing and provide a complementary, inexpensive, minimally invasive, and scalable techniques to support early detection for research purposes [\n15\n]. They can also capture changes in real-life (i.e., outside of the clinic) behavior, which may offer advantages over traditional methods, such as pen and paper cognitive screening tests such as the General Practitioner Assessment of Cognition (GPCOG) [\n7\n].", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/63", "#/texts/64", "#/texts/65", "#/texts/66", "#/texts/67", "#/texts/68", "#/texts/69", "#/texts/70", "#/texts/71", "#/texts/72", "#/texts/73", "#/texts/74", "#/texts/75", "#/texts/76", "#/texts/77", "#/texts/78", "#/texts/79", "#/texts/80", "#/texts/81", "#/texts/82", "#/texts/83", "#/texts/84", "#/texts/85", "#/texts/86", "#/texts/87", "#/texts/88", "#/texts/89", "#/texts/90", "#/texts/91", "#/texts/92", "#/texts/93", "#/texts/94", "#/texts/95", "#/texts/96"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "3f65c807-6064-40d4-9dc8-c398cd5e1459"}

This includes seeking the perspectives of those most at risk of developing dementia-causing diseases, for example, people with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) (the self-reported experience of worsening cognitive function) [\n19\n,\n20\n], and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (an intermediate cognitive state between normal aging and dementia, although not everyone with MCI progresses to dementia) [\n21\n,\n22\n]. It is also important to seek the views of those with a clinical diagnosis of dementia as their data, collected from wearables, could be used to monitor their disease progression; their caregivers are also likely be involved in supporting the use of this technology.\nPrevious research suggests specific features of technologies, such as aesthetics, can influence the acceptance of wearable technologies among people living with dementia and their caregivers [\n23\n]. Acceptability may also change with users' experience with an intervention [\n24\n]. Thus, we aimed to explore the perspectives of those living with a clinical diagnosis of dementia, SCD and MCI and their caregivers on the acceptability of the use of four wearable technologies measuring modalities of physical activity, sleep and cognitive function.\n\nAcceptability of wearable technology for the early detection of dementia-causing diseases: perspectives from the CODEC II cohort\nMethod\nStudy design\nThis study is part of the 'Early Detection of Neurodegenerative Diseases Initiative' (EDoN), an international consortium seeking to develop a clinically appropriate toolkit, composed of wearable technologies to support the early detection of dementia-causing diseases [\n15\n].

Anonymized responses (e.g., birth year provided to calculate age) for those taking part in this qualitative sub-study were shared securely with the qualitative research team.\nSemi-structured interviews were conducted at the end of participants' first two weeks of using the technologies (between February 2023 and October 2023) to gather their initial perspectives and experiences.

The five main stages of the approach were followed, starting with the lead researcher (SW) familiarizing herself with the data by reading and rereading the transcripts. Initial codes were generated inductively by creating concepts in the data without preconceptions [\n29\n]. Codes with shared meanings were grouped into themes, forming an initial framework that was applied across the complete dataset. Data were charted into a matrix (row [themes], sub-row [sub-theme, i.e., codes], column [relevant quote]) to summarize the data [\n27\n,\n28\n]. Themes were refined using the constant comparative technique to move back and forth between the data, comparing and contracting themes and evolving explanations until a fit was made [\n30\n]. The lead researcher (SW) mapped these themes to a preexisting framework, the Intelligent Systems Technology Acceptance Model (ISTAM) [\n31\n] to support the refinement of key themes [\n32\n]. ISTAM is an expansion of the technology acceptance model (TAM) that incorporates aspects such as transparency, which affect users' acceptance of intelligent systems (e.g., AI, robotics, machine learning) (Fig.\n2\n) [\n31\n]. Apparent 'negative cases' were further examined to refine explanations [\n32\n]. Discussions with coauthors (SW, EB, CT, SPS, and RMA) and the wider CODEC-II research team (RM, SB, TW) were conducted at several stages throughout the analytical process.\nFig. 2\nData collection continued until data saturation was reached at 21 interviews.

Our use of the framework approach, which supports an inductive analysis followed by deductive analysis, aided the examination and refinement of existing technology acceptance theories. However, this study only included a sub-sample of participants from one cohort based in Essex who may hold different views compared to individuals residing in other areas of the UK. For example, the North East of England has the highest prevalence of individuals with low levels of digital engagement (32%) [\n69\n], low digital competency (28%) [\n70\n], and offline individuals (i.e., those who do not use internet enabled devices or internet based communication routes or information sources (5% in 2023 vs England's average of 3.6%) [\n70\n]. Within certain areas of the North East, older adults in particular, are extremely likely to face digital inequities as 94% of digitally excluded residents in North Tyneside were over 60 years old [\n71\n]. Thus, individuals residing in a region with low digital engagement and digital competencies may hold different opinions and perspectives on the use of technology to support the early detection of dementia causing diseases. Furthermore, this study excluded those who could not speak English, did not have a smartphone or internet access and lacked representation of underserved groups who are known to be at risk of digital exclusion, such as individuals without a fixed address or from ethnic minority groups [\n72\n]. The use of remote interviews may have unintentionally excluded those with low digital literacy skills and/or those without access to adequate connectivity to support the use of technologies in such a manner, as some participants with access to slow connectivity (Wi-Fi) bandwidth faced buffering issues when using zoom. Mitigating digital exclusion is vital when promoting inclusivity of digital health technologies, as failing to do so can exacerbate health inequities, with underserved groups facing additional barriers when using, accessing, and/or feeling motivated to use digital technology for healthcare purposes [\n73", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/421", "#/texts/422", "#/texts/423", "#/texts/424", "#/texts/425", "#/texts/426", "#/texts/427", "#/texts/428", "#/texts/429", "#/texts/430", "#/texts/431", "#/texts/432", "#/texts/433", "#/texts/434", "#/texts/435", "#/texts/436"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "24097c95-5dba-4b60-ae09-70f66ba71054"}

There was no prior relationship between the participants and the research team. The interviewer was trained by a team member (SW, a Research Assistant who has an MSc in Cognitive Neuroscience and human neuroimaging) experienced in interviewing individuals with cognitive impairment and dementia. The researchers involved in the analysis (SW, CT, SS, RMA) were experienced qualitative researchers at various career stages, with diverse academic backgrounds in pharmacy, neuroscience, and digital health equity.
