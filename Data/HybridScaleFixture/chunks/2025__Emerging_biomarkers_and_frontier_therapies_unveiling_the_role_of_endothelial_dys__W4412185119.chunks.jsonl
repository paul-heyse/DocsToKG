Despite its clinical significance, the underlying mechanisms of cSVD remain incompletely understood, and therapeutic options are limited. Mounting evidence has pinpointed endothelial dysfunction as a central driver in cSVD pathogenesis, which disrupts blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity, impairs cerebral blood flow autoregulation, and promotes neuroinflammation. The vascular endothelium, serving as a dynamic interface between blood and brain parenchyma, plays a crucial role in maintaining vascular homeostasis through functions like nitric oxide (NO)-mediated vasodilation, anti-thrombotic signaling, and immune regulation. In cSVD, chronic endothelial injury triggered by factors such as hypertension, oxidative stress, or genetic predisposition leads to microvascular rarefaction, pericyte loss, and gliosis, ultimately resulting in characteristic manifestations like white matter hyperintensities, lacunar infarcts, and cerebral microbleeds. Our review stands out by comprehensively integrating the latest research on emerging biomarkers and frontier therapeutic strategies specifically related to the cSVD-endothelium interplay. Recent breakthroughs in biomarker discovery, including novel circulating endothelial microparticles subtypes and advanced neuroimaging-derived biomarkers, offer unprecedented insights into endothelial health in cSVD. These biomarkers not only aid in early diagnosis but also enable more accurate risk stratification and monitoring of therapeutic responses. Concurrently, this review delves into the latest preclinical and clinical trial progress of innovative therapeutic strategies targeting endothelial repair. By bridging mechanistic insights with clinical translation, this review aims to highlight novel pathways for early intervention and personalized management of cSVD, thereby advancing the field beyond previous reviews that mainly focused on established knowledge. Relevant studies were retrieved from databases such as PubMed and Web of Science, covering the period up to 2025, to synthesize the latest evidence on endothelial dysfunction in cSVD.

While there is growing recognition of the impact of cSVD on global health, specific data on individual stroke subtypes-such as lacunar stroke-remains relatively limited, especially in these regions (\n4\n). A recent review by Lam et al. (\n5\n) highlights the high prevalence of imaging features associated with cSVD in LMICs. The study reported that between 20.5% and 58.4% of individuals in community, stroke, and dementia groups exhibited moderate-to-severe white WMH, which is a key radiological marker of cSVD (\n5\n). These findings indicate that cSVD is a widespread concern, even in populations with limited healthcare resources (\n6\n). This data from LMICs aligns with findings from high-income countries, where WMH and other radiological features of cSVD are similarly common (\n5\n). However, the need for more comprehensive studies in LMICs is crucial. A deeper understanding of the global prevalence of cSVD and its regional variations would help in tailoring preventive strategies and health policies to address the burden more effectively. Moreover, certain non-western populations, particularly in Asia, show an even higher burden of cSVD, which is often linked to an increased risk of dementia (\n7\n). In these regions, the presence of cSVD lesions appears to have a synergistic effect with Alzheimer's disease (AD), lowering the threshold for the development of clinically significant dementia (\n8\n).

However, conventional MRI may only capture the more obvious lesions, missing subtle changes that could be present in other areas of the brain (\n10\n). More advanced imaging techniques like diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) are more sensitive and can detect alterations in diffusion properties in regions that appear normal on traditional MRI scans (\n11\n).

This condition is closely associated with aging and vascular risk factors, with hypertension being a key contributor. In age-related non-amyloid cSVD, arteriosclerosis of small vessels plays a pivotal role. Additionally, lacunar infarcts in sporadic cSVD can result from microatheromas at the origin of perforating arteries, a finding supported by previous research and modern high-resolution imaging techniques such as 7 T MRI (\n10\n).\n\nEmerging biomarkers and frontier therapies: unveiling the role of endothelial dysfunction in cerebral small vessel disease\n1 What is cerebral small vessel disease?\n1.3 Pathogenesis of cerebral small vessel disease\n1.3.2 Amyloid-angiopathy-related cSVD\nCerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is characterized by the deposition of \u03b2-amyloid in the blood vessel walls.

Under normal conditions, endothelial cells help regulate blood flow, act as a selective barrier, and respond to signals involved in inflammatory processes. In the brain, these cells form the BBB, characterized by tight junctions between the cells that protect the brain from harmful substances while allowing the selective passage of molecules into the brain tissue (\n18\n).\nWhen endothelial cells become dysfunctional, they lose these protective functions and may acquire new, harmful characteristics. A hallmark of EC dysfunction is a reduced ability to produce and release nitric oxide, which normally helps dilate blood vessels (\n19\n). This results in impaired vascular responses. Although endothelial dysfunction and vascular dysfunction are related, they are distinct processes. Vascular dysfunction can also arise independently of ECs, originating from pericytes or smooth muscle cells. Additionally, endothelial activation, characterized by the upregulation of adhesion molecules like VCAM-1 (\n20\n), ICAM-1 (\n21\n), and E-selectin (\n22\n), often occurs in response to inflammation and is linked to endothelial dysfunction but is considered a separate phenomenon.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/309", "#/texts/310", "#/texts/311", "#/texts/312", "#/texts/313", "#/texts/314", "#/texts/315", "#/texts/316", "#/texts/317", "#/texts/318", "#/texts/319", "#/texts/320", "#/texts/321", "#/texts/322"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "af803cfa-8d18-46dc-8670-42e4730b8592"}

In the brain, ECs are essential for maintaining the integrity of the BBB, regulating molecular transport, and facilitating processes like blood clotting and neurovascular coupling-matching blood flow to neural activity. They also interact with brain cells on their albuminal side, further influencing brain function. When ECs become dysfunctional, these processes are disrupted, contributing to the development and progression of cSVD, a condition linked to various subtypes based on its cause and pathology (\n23\n).\nIn particular, endothelial dysfunction is increasingly recognized as a key factor in the mechanisms driving parenchymal changes in cSVD. Dysfunctional ECs impair the BBB and neurovascular coupling, leading to changes in white matter (WM). This disruption is thought to occur through altered cellular interactions and secretions from ECs.

One of the primary pharmacological interventions is antiplatelet therapy, which is commonly used in ischemic stroke. The administration of antiplatelet agents such as aspirin has been shown to reduce recurrent stroke risk by about 30% after acute subcortical infarction (\n57\n). By reducing platelet aggregation, these drugs may help mitigate microvascular injury, which is a key contributor to endothelial damage in cSVD. However, antiplatelet therapy also carries significant risks, such as an increased risk of bleeding. In some patients, especially those with a history of gastrointestinal ulcers or other bleeding disorders, the use of antiplatelet agents may lead to severe hemorrhagic events, potentially outweighing the benefits (\n58\n). Moreover, there is evidence of interindividual variability in the response to antiplatelet drugs, with some patients failing to achieve the expected antiplatelet effect, limiting the universal effectiveness of this treatment approach.\nAntihypertensive therapy is another cornerstone of cSVD management. Elevated blood pressure is a significant risk factor for endothelial dysfunction and the progression of WMH. Intensive antihypertensive treatment has been associated with less progression of WMH compared to standard guidelines for blood pressure reduction (\n59\n). By reducing systemic vascular resistance, antihypertensive agents alleviate the hemodynamic stress on small vessels, thereby reducing endothelial injury. Nevertheless, overly aggressive antihypertensive treatment can also pose risks. Excessive blood pressure reduction may lead to cerebral hypoperfusion, especially in patients with pre-existing cerebrovascular stenosis, potentially triggering ischemic events (\n60\n). Additionally, some antihypertensive medications may have adverse side effects, such as electrolyte imbalances or sexual dysfunction, which can affect patient compliance and the long-term effectiveness of the treatment (\n61\n).", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/429", "#/texts/430", "#/texts/431", "#/texts/432", "#/texts/433", "#/texts/434", "#/texts/435", "#/texts/436", "#/texts/437", "#/texts/438", "#/texts/439", "#/texts/440"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "79349d71-11d3-4dac-8d92-cfe4308e748b"}

Statins, such as low-dose rosuvastatin, have been found to slow WMH progression, suggesting that their effects on endothelial function may extend beyond cholesterol reduction (\n62\n). Statins may exert direct beneficial effects on endothelial cells by enhancing endothelial nitric oxide production, which in turn improves vascular relaxation and reduces endothelial cell apoptosis. However, the Prevention of Decline in Cognition after Stroke Trial (PODCAST) showed limited effects of statins and blood pressure management on cognitive decline, indicating that the impact of statin therapy on cSVD-related cognitive outcomes may be more complex than initially thought (\n63\n). Moreover, statins are associated with a range of side effects, including muscle pain, liver enzyme elevation, and an increased risk of new-onset diabetes, which may limit their long-term use in some patients.

Cilostazol, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, has shown potential in preclinical studies as a means to enhance endothelial function and reduce cerebrovascular damage in cSVD. By promoting endothelial cell survival and stabilizing the microvasculature, cilostazol has been found to reduce cognitive decline and ameliorate gliovascular damage in animal models of cSVD (\n65\n). However, translating preclinical findings to clinical practice presents significant challenges. The results from preclinical studies may not always be replicated in human trials due to differences in pathophysiological mechanisms between animals and humans. Additionally, ongoing clinical trials, such as the Lacunar Intervention (LACI-1 and LACI-2) studies, are investigating the efficacy of cilostazol in treating cSVD-related cognitive decline, but these trials are still in progress. There is a risk that the trials may not meet their primary endpoints, and even if they do, the therapeutic window of cilostazol may be narrow, requiring careful dosing and monitoring. Moreover, potential side effects of cilostazol, such as headache, nausea, and palpitations, may limit patient tolerance and compliance, which need to be thoroughly evaluated in larger-scale clinical trials. These trials may provide further insight into endothelial-targeted therapies for cSVD (\n66\n,\n67\n), but it is essential to approach the development of cilostazol-based treatments with caution.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/449", "#/texts/450", "#/texts/451", "#/texts/452", "#/texts/453", "#/texts/454", "#/texts/455"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "bfc5cccf-c102-4d61-b21f-e47e8822fb15"}

Minocycline, an anti-inflammatory agent, has demonstrated potential in alleviating endothelial injury and reducing white matter damage in cSVD models. In preclinical studies, minocycline has been shown to decrease neuroinflammation, improve white matter integrity, and enhance cognitive performance in animal models of cSVD (\n68\n). Its ability to modulate immune responses and protect endothelial cells makes it a promising candidate for further exploration in clinical settings. Other anti-inflammatory agents, including fingolimod, natalizumab, and rituximab, have shown efficacy in neuroinflammatory conditions and may be potential therapies for endothelial protection in cSVD (\n69\n). However, these agents also carry significant risks. Fingolimod is associated with bradycardia and an increased risk of infections, natalizumab has been linked to progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, a rare but serious viral brain infection, and rituximab can cause infusion-related reactions and immunosuppression.

A number of studies utilize bioinformatics analyses to discover endothelial injury biomarkers like ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, but the lack of validation in large-scale, multicenter clinical cohorts undermines their reliability. For example, although circulating endothelial microparticles and adhesion molecules seem to be associated with cSVD imaging markers, their diagnostic value has not been established in independent studies, as the area under the curve (AUC) values are typically derived from single-center samples (\n28\n,\n30\n). The small cohort sizes, with most studies involving fewer than 200 participants, not only introduce selection bias but also fail to account for ethnic and age-related variability, further restricting clinical translation (\n5\n).\nMoreover, the use of transcriptomic approaches to identify biomarkers has its own drawbacks. These methods mainly capture transcriptional changes, yet many crucial biomarkers, such as eNOS and selectins, are membrane receptors or secreted proteins. Since the functional activity of these biomarkers, including NO bioavailability or adhesion molecule activation, cannot be accurately determined by mRNA levels alone-considering that reduced eNOS expression may not necessarily correlate with decreased NO production due to post-translational modifications like phosphorylation by AKT-this creates a disconnect between molecular profiling and actual functional significance (\n33\n,\n34\n).
