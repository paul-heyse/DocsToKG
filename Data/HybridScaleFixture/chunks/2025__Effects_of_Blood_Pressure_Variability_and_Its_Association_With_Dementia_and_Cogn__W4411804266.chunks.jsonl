A comprehensive search was conducted in databases, including PubMed, Research Gate, Google Scholar, and Science Direct. The inclusion criteria required studies that examined the association between blood pressure variability and the occurrence or progression of dementia and cognitive impairment. Two independent reviewers evaluated each study's quality and potential bias using study-specific tools before inclusion.\nResults:\nThere were 17 studies, including four systematic reviews and meta-analyses, four randomized controlled trials, and nine observational studies, with 16,985,492 participants. The findings indicated that late-life blood pressure had a stronger association with cognitive function than midlife blood pressure. Hypertension was linked to an increased risk of all-cause dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and vascular dementia. Anti-hypertensive medications could reduce the risk of dementia or cognitive impairment, although the specific type of medication did not significantly affect overall cognitive performance. A significant limitation of this review was the heterogeneity in diagnostic criteria, cognitive assessment tools, and imaging techniques used among the studies, which limited direct comparisons and conclusive findings.\nConclusion:\nBlood pressure variability emerged as a potential predictor for cognitive impairment. Implementing strategies to reduce blood pressure variability may help mitigate the risk of dementia and improve cognitive outcomes in vulnerable populations.\n\nEffects of Blood Pressure Variability and Its Association With Dementia and Cognitive Impairment: A Systematic Review\nAbstract\nMetrics\nMetrics Loading ...", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/47", "#/texts/49", "#/texts/51", "#/texts/52", "#/texts/53", "#/texts/54", "#/texts/55", "#/texts/56", "#/texts/57", "#/texts/58", "#/texts/60"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "9bf01a40-04aa-4b26-8cef-b1a9bab68594"}
