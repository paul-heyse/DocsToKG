Compared to non-coffee consumers, individuals consuming\u2009\u2265\u2009480 g/day of coffee had a significantly lower odds of low CERAD scores, with an adjusted OR of 0.58 (95% CI: 0.41-0.82) in the fully adjusted Model 4. Similarly, those consuming caffeinated coffee 477.9 g/day) had an OR of 0.56 (95% CI: 0.34-0.92). A comparison of the lowest quartile of ALP intake with the highest quartile showed an OR of 1.82 (95% CI: 1.16-2.85), indicating a negative correlation with cognitive performance. Mendelian Randomization (MR) studies suggested that increased coffee intake is associated with cognitive impairment progression, while coffee consumption may protect against Lewy body dementia (OR\u2009=\u20090.2365, 95% CI: 0.0582-0.9610). Additionally, coffee/caffeine intake affected serum ALP (OR\u2009=\u20090.86, 95% CI: 0.79-0.93) and cognitive ability (OR\u2009=\u20090.95, 95% CI: 0.92-0.98), both indicating protective effects.

It is estimated that by 2050, over 130 million individuals will be affected by dementia, making the search for effective prevention and intervention strategies urgent [\n1\n].\nCoffee is one of the most popular and consumed beverages worldwide, and caffeine is its best-known component. The cognitive-enhancing effects of caffeine are well-documented, primarily through its action as an adenosine receptor antagonist, which promotes wakefulness and improves attention and memory consolidation [\n2\n]. Caffeine (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine) shares remarkable structural homology with the endogenous neuromodulator adenosine, enabling its specific binding to adenosine receptor subtypes (including A1 and A2A). Emerging evidence demonstrates that caffeine administration significantly suppresses the expression of \u03b2-secretase (BACE1) and \u03b3-secretase, thereby effectively reducing \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) production and ameliorating both cognitive deficits and neuropathological hallmarks in transgenic models of Alzheimer's disease [\n3\n]. Current evidence indicates caffeine is also believed to enhance alertness, attention and mood, and is thought to have a positive impact on long-term memory [\n4\n,\n5\n].\nMeanwhile, caffeine, as a multi-target neuromodulator, can significantly affect the dopaminergic, cholinergic and glutaminergic pathways closely related to neurodegenerative diseases [\n6\n].", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/52", "#/texts/53", "#/texts/54", "#/texts/55", "#/texts/56", "#/texts/57", "#/texts/58", "#/texts/59", "#/texts/60", "#/texts/61", "#/texts/62", "#/texts/63", "#/texts/64", "#/texts/65", "#/texts/66"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "7fbbb058-d09f-48f6-b4f8-4ca4638c2bd0"}

Epidemiological studies suggest that moderate caffeine intake is associated with better cognitive performance, and some laboratory studies have demonstrated neuroprotective properties of caffeine in animal models [\n7\n]. Some scholars also believe that there is a nonlinear \"U-shaped\" dose-effect relationship between caffeine intake and the risk of cognitive impairment, that is, caffeine at an appropriate dose can effectively reduce the occurrence of cognitive impairment [\n8\n]. However, results are inconsistent, with some studies failing to establish a significant impact of caffeine on human cognitive function [\n9\n]. Additionally, the effects of caffeine may be influenced by gender, genetic factors and the time of consumption [\n10\n], further complicating its investigation [\n11\n].\nIn cognitive neuroscience research, the systematic assessment of the cognitive domain usually covers core dimensions such as memory function, information processing and language ability, as well as their neurobiological basis. At present, there is heterogeneity in the results of caffeine's impact on memory function, which is largely due to the insufficiently detailed classification of memory subtypes. For instance, the latest research indicates that caffeine has differentiated regulatory effects on different memory systems - prospective memory and implicit memory show significant enhancement after acute caffeine intake [\n12\n]. In terms of information processing, caffeine shows a domain-selective enhancement effect. In terms of reward processing: It can shorten the response time to reward-related stimuli by enhancing the activation of the ventral striatum [\n13\n]. In terms of continuous attention: It can regulate the dopamine D1 receptor in the prefrontal lobe under sleep deprivation conditions, thereby improving the accuracy of alertness tasks [\n14\n].The inconsistent results regarding the cognitive effects of caffeine may stem from the insufficient degree of segmentation in different cognitive domains.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/67", "#/texts/68", "#/texts/69", "#/texts/70", "#/texts/71", "#/texts/72", "#/texts/73", "#/texts/74", "#/texts/75", "#/texts/76", "#/texts/77", "#/texts/78", "#/texts/79", "#/texts/80", "#/texts/81", "#/texts/82", "#/texts/83", "#/texts/84"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "3f712348-8b08-4a7e-bc25-1f627aea86f8"}

The human genome contains four ALP genes, encoding intestinal type (IAP), placental type (PLAP), germ cell type (GCAP) and tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) [\n15\n]. Studies have shown that TNAP shows a unique expression pattern in neurodegenerative diseases: it is significantly increased in brain tissue and peripheral blood in patients with sporadic Alzheimer's disease (sAD) and familial Alzheimer's disease (fAD), but similar changes are not observed in normal aging [\n16\n], This differential expression profile makes TNAP a potential novel biomarker to distinguish pathological cognitive decline, such as AD, from physiological aging [\n17\n]. As a competitive adenosine receptor antagonist, caffeine exhibits complex neuromodulatory effects during development. Animal experiments have shown that maternal caffeine intake can inhibit protein synthesis and membrane cholesterol metabolism in the brain of neonatal rats in a dose-dependent manner [\n18\n], this effect may be related to the inhibition of ALP activity by caffeine through A1 receptors and the interference of zinc ion homeostasis [\n19\n]. However, direct evidence is lacking on whether the inhibitory effects of caffeine on the developing nervous system will translate into neuroprotective effects in old age.\nWhile the adenosine-mediated pathway represents the primary mechanism of caffeine's action, other biological pathways may contribute to its cognitive effects. ALP, an important enzyme, has been shown to play a critical role in neuronal development and functional maintenance [\n20\n,\n21\n]. Research indicates that ALP activity increases during brain injury and in patients with cognitive impairment, exhibiting a negative correlation with cognitive performance [\n22\n].

This study employs a complex, stratified, multistage sampling method to ensure that it captures a representative sample from the non-institutionalized population. Participants first complete a home interview, and then they receive health examinations at mobile examination centers (MEC). As of now, the official NHANES documentation (\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/\n) does not provide a clear specification of the time interval between the household interview and the health assessment at the Mobile Examination Center (MEC). This interval appears to depend on scheduling coordination between participants and the survey team, and may range from several days to a few weeks, with no standardized timeframe explicitly stated. The study protocols have been ethically approved by the National Center for Health Statistics Ethics Review Board at the CDC, and all participants provide written informed consent prior to involvement.\nFor this analysis, data from the 2011-2012 and 2013-2014 survey cycles were combined, focusing on coffee and caffeine intake and cognitive function measures. Out of 19,931 individuals who participated in NHANES during this period, 2,934 were aged 60 years or older.

These assessments were conducted at mobile examination centers (MEC) and included the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) Word Learning sub-test, the Animal Fluency test, and the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) [\n23\n,\n24\n]. These tools were designed to evaluate various cognitive domains, such as working memory, language skills, processing speed, and executive function. Participants provided informed consent for the audio recording of the testing sessions, which aided in quality control. Responses were transcribed and scored by two interviewers, in both English and Spanish, typically on the same day. For those who spoke different languages, verbatim transcriptions were made, and scores were assigned later by language consultants, with any discrepancies resolved by a third party. About 10% of the interviews underwent independent review.\nThe CERAD test consists of three learning trials followed by a delayed recall component, designed to assess participants' immediate and delayed verbal information recall abilities. During the testing process, participants are required to read aloud a list of ten unrelated words and then immediately recall as many words as possible. Delayed recall occurs after the verbal fluency test and the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST). Each learning trial scores range from 0 to 10, and the overall CERAD score is calculated by summing the scores from all trials and the delayed recall, reflecting the participants' mastery of verbal information. The Animal Fluency test aims to evaluate participants' categorical language fluency, asking them to name as many animals as possible within one minute. Concurrently, the DSST assesses participants' processing speed, sustained attention, and working memory, with scores ranging from 0 to 133 based on the number of correct matches. However, DSST provides only the total score based on the number of correct symbol-digit matches completed within a fixed time period, without separate measures of reaction time or latency. Therefore, in this study, we used the DSST total score as a proxy for cognitive processing speed, consistent with previous research [\n25\n,\n26\n].", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/121", "#/texts/122", "#/texts/123", "#/texts/124", "#/texts/125", "#/texts/126", "#/texts/127", "#/texts/128", "#/texts/129", "#/texts/130"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "d0691500-9e5c-4006-9917-70ac3296f828"}

This suggests the significant role of ALP in the nervous system. Tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) is a specific isoenzyme of ALP that is widely expressed in various tissues, particularly in the brain, where it plays a crucial role. TNAP is expressed in both developing and adult mammalian brains, with strong expression in the developing nervous system that is closely associated with neurogenic activity. Although TNAP expression decreases later in development, it remains highly expressed in the subventricular zone of the adult lateral ventricles, supporting the generation of new neurons in the olfactory bulb. Despite its widespread presence, the expression and physiological regulatory functions of TNAP in neural tissues are still poorly understood, which may contribute to its limited attention in neurological research [\n50\n]. Nonetheless, the strong expression of TNAP in the developing brain highlights its important role in neurodevelopment. Additionally, studies have suggested that TNAP may serve as a potential biomarker for gout and various diseases, with gout complications including Alzheimer's disease (AD) [\n51\n], thereby indirectly supporting our research findings.\nResearch indicates that tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP), particularly its isoenzymes, can exacerbate the neurotoxicity of tau protein by promoting its hyperphosphorylation, thereby triggering neuroinflammatory responses and aberrant synaptic phagocytosis by microglia [\n52\n]. This pathological cascade further induces mitochondrial dysfunction and reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, intensifying cerebral oxidative stress and ultimately aggravating cognitive impairment [\n53\n]. Intervention studies demonstrate that ameliorating mitochondrial function can effectively rescue synaptic loss in mouse models and significantly improve cognitive performance. Furthermore, epidemiological investigations reveal that caffeine consumption exhibits protective effects on cognitive function in specific populations, such as Mediterranean elderly individuals with metabolic syndrome [\n54\n].", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/436", "#/texts/437", "#/texts/438", "#/texts/439", "#/texts/440", "#/texts/441", "#/texts/442", "#/texts/443", "#/texts/444", "#/texts/445", "#/texts/446", "#/texts/447"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "f7a60c23-f0dc-486e-a2af-fb3acc5b5deb"}

In Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, the protein expression level and enzyme activity of TNAP are significantly increased in the temporal lobe and hippocampus (the core regions of abnormal tau deposition), suggesting that TNAP may be involved in the pathological process of AD and play a dual regulatory role. On the one hand, TNAP catalyzes the dephosphorylation of extracellular ATP to generate adenosine, which not only inhibits neuroinflammation but also helps maintain blood-brain barrier homeostasis [\n56\n]. Adenosine accumulation may play a neuroprotective role by activating adenosine receptors, such as A1 receptors. On the other hand, recent evidence suggests that TNAP may mediate the dephosphorylation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein and promote its abnormal interaction with muscarinic receptors, which may interfere with intracellular calcium homeostasis and eventually lead to apoptosis. This mechanism may explain the potential promoting role of TNAP in AD neurodegeneration [\n57\n].\nWe found that caffeine intake has been found to significantly reduce ALP levels in the body, which may have profound implications for the function of tissue-nonspecific ALP. TNAP plays multiple critical roles in the brain, including involvement in the formation and maintenance of the blood-brain barrier [\n56\n], synthesis of neurotransmitters [\n58\n], interaction with the extracellular matrix [\n59\n], and regulation of neuroinflammation [\n60\n,\n61\n]. The activity of TNAP is crucial during neurodevelopment, as its high expression during brain development supports the growth and differentiation of neurons.

This phenomenon suggests that TNAP may play a complex role in neural injury and recovery processes. Whether caffeine intake can mitigate neuronal damage or inflammatory responses by inhibiting TNAP activity is an important question worth exploring [\n60\n]. Specifically, caffeine may exert its anti-inflammatory effects by impacting TNAP's role in regulating neuroinflammation, thereby alleviating inflammation triggered by neural damage. This mechanism not only helps elucidate the potential neuroprotective effects of caffeine but also provides a theoretical basis for developing new therapeutic strategies.\nHowever, it is important to note that long-term caffeine use may negatively affect the physiological functions of TNAP. While caffeine may help reduce inflammatory responses in the short term, prolonged suppression of TNAP activity could disrupt its essential roles in neurodevelopment and maintenance of neural function. Research indicates that TNAP is indispensable for neuronal development, synaptogenesis, and functional maintenance [\n66\n,\n67\n]; thus, chronic caffeine intake may lead to neural developmental issues or functional impairments.

Previous studies have indicated that IGFLR1 is closely linked to the regulation of cancer activation, intercellular adhesion among lymphocytes, and drug resistance, suggesting its critical function within the tumor microenvironment [\n68\n]. Conversely, ALP affects intracellular signaling pathways through its dephosphorylation activity [\n69\n].

In terms of the types of caffeine and its mechanism of action, existing studies have shown that caffeine from natural sources (such as caffeine in coffee and tea) usually coexists with polyphenolic compounds (such as chlorogenic acid in coffee, catechin in tea) and a variety of antioxidants, which may synergistically inhibit the phosphorylation activity of TNAP, thereby more effectively reducing ALP levels. In contrast, synthetic caffeine, such as caffeine in energy drinks and pharmaceuticals, may require higher doses to achieve equivalent ALP inhibition due to the lack of these natural synergistic components, which may become a new direction for future research.\n3. 6. It is worth noting that although our study analyzed overall intake of caffeinated coffee, different types and modes of coffee consumption-such as pure black coffee versus coffee with added milk, plant-based milk, sugar, or creamer-may be associated with distinct metabolic profiles and health effects. These variations could stem from the influence of added ingredients on the absorption, metabolism, or bioavailability of bioactive compounds in coffee, such as caffeine and polyphenols. Moreover, individual preferences for specific coffee types may correlate with lifestyle factors or health status, introducing potential confounding. Therefore, future studies should aim to enhance both sample size and granularity of dietary data collection, particularly by capturing detailed patterns of coffee consumption. This would enable more refined subgroup or stratified sensitivity analyses, which are essential to uncover potential heterogeneity in health outcomes associated with different coffee consumption habits and to support more tailored dietary recommendations.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/500", "#/texts/501", "#/texts/502"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "f64f7e1a-dfc2-4f05-9cba-7ec5bf6aebd4"}

In addition, coffee brand and brewing parameters were not recorded in the study, and there may still be differences in the bioavailability of caffeine among different individuals, which may affect the individual differences in caffeine metabolism. Current dose-response analysis is mainly based on cross-sectional data, which fails to establish long-term follow-up dose-response curves, especially lack of real-time monitoring data of dynamic changes in blood-brain barrier permeability. Future research recommendations include: (1) individualized dose adjustment in combination with pharmacogenomic testing (e.g., CYP1A2 genotyping); (2) To simultaneously monitor the BBB permeability of caffeine from different sources using organoid models or microdialysis technology; (3) to establish the dynamic association between caffeine intake and ALP activity in a long-term cohort study. These improvements should allow more precise assessment of the neuroprotective effects of caffeine.\n\nExploring the impact of coffee consumption and caffeine intake on cognitive performance in older adults: a comprehensive analysis using NHANES data and gene correlation analysis\nConclusion\nThis study provides important empirical evidence regarding the relationship between coffee consumption, caffeine intake, ALP activity, and cognitive function in older adults. The results indicate a significant positive correlation between coffee and caffeine intake and cognitive performance, with ALP potentially serving as a mediating factor. Specifically, higher levels of coffee and caffeine consumption are closely associated with improved cognitive abilities, particularly in memory and processing speed. Furthermore, the critical role of ALP in neural health further elucidates the complex interplay among these variables.\n\nExploring the impact of coffee consumption and caffeine intake on cognitive performance in older adults: a comprehensive analysis using NHANES data and gene correlation analysis\nData availability\nData is provided within the manuscript.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/503", "#/texts/505", "#/texts/507"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "ef9d4043-6a00-44ad-a3fc-3ca98badba55"}
