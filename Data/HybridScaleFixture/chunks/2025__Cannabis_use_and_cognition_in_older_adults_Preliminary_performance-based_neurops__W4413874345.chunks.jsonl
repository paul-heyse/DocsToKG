Participants completed a standardized questionnaire assessing cannabis use in the six months prior to the study visit and completed a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment. We used traditional cross-sectional analyses (multivariate, univariate) alongside causal inference techniques (propensity score matching [PSM]) to evaluate group differences according to recent cannabis use status. We also examined whether cannabis-related problem severity, a risk factor for cannabis use disorder (CUD), was associated with cognitive outcomes among those reporting recent cannabis use.\nResults:\nApproximately 11% of participants reported using cannabis in the prior six months, with the median user consuming cannabis two to four times per month. Participants with recent cannabis use performed similarly across all five domains of neuropsychological functioning compared to those with no cannabis use. Among older adults reporting recent cannabis use, those with elevated risk for CUD demonstrated lower memory performance.\nConclusions:\nThese preliminary results are broadly consistent with other findings indicating that low-frequency cannabis use among older adults, including those along the dementia continuum, is generally well tolerated from a cognitive perspective. However, among older adults who used cannabis, elevated symptoms of CUD may negatively impact memory performance. Future research should explore how variations in cannabis use patterns, individual characteristics, and clinical phenotypes influence cognitive outcomes.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/437", "#/texts/438", "#/texts/439", "#/texts/440", "#/texts/442", "#/texts/443", "#/texts/444", "#/texts/445", "#/texts/446", "#/texts/447", "#/texts/448", "#/texts/449"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "765ee5ec-fb79-4002-8e9e-7eed0b6b029f"}

Approximately 2 - 7% of older adults in North America report using cannabis in the past month, with 2019 estimates revealing that 27% of older adults using cannabis were first-time users (Jeffers et al.\nReference Jeffers, Glantz, Byers and Keyhani 2021\n; Maxwell et al.\nReference Maxwell, Jesdale and Lapane 2021\n; Statistics Canada,\n2019\n). Older adults who consume cannabis now use at rates comparable to that of younger-aged peers, with approximately 60% reporting frequent or daily use (Jeffers et al.\nReference Jeffers, Glantz, Byers and Keyhani 2021\n).

Residual effects of heavy cannabis use on cognition typically resolve within three weeks with sustained abstinence (Crean et al.\nReference Crean, Crane and Mason 2011\n; Meier et al.\nReference Meier, Caspi, Danese, Fisher, Houts, Arseneault and Moffitt 2018\n; Ross et al.\nReference Ross, Ellingson, Rhee, Hewitt, Corley, Lessem and Friedman 2020\n). However, some evidence supports persisting negative impacts on cognition for long-term, heavy users who initiate use during the neurodevelopmental period (age 25 and younger) and those with significant symptoms of cannabis use disorder (CUD) (Crean et al.\nReference Crean, Crane and Mason 2011\n; Kroon et al.\nReference Kroon, Kuhns, Hoch and Cousijn 2020\n; Lovell et al.\nReference Lovell, Akhurst, Padgett, Garry and Matthews 2020\n).

Reviews focused on the cognitive effects of cannabis use in older adults, including those with cognitive decline and dementia, have concluded that low-dose, short-term medical cannabis use is generally well tolerated in older adults and does not confer significant risk for adverse cognitive outcomes (Scott et al.\nReference Scott, Brennan and Benitez 2019\n; Vacaflor et al.\nReference Vacaflor, Beauchet, Jarvis, Schiavetto and Rej 2020\n). Reviews incorporating both human and animal studies have identified potential neuroprotective properties of cannabis on cognition. For example, Pocuca et al. (\nReference Pocuca, Walter, Minassian, Young, Geyer and Perry 2021\n) noted methodological limitations impacting the largely null effects of cannabis use on older adult cognition in human studies, while observing that better controlled animal models indicate that very low doses of THC improved cognition in very old rodents while slightly higher chronic doses of THC improved cognition in moderately aged rodents. Similarly, Weinstein and Sznitman (\nReference Weinstein and Sznitman 2020\n) also note important brain-age differences and emphasized the potential for cannabis to confer neuroprotective effects in older adults specifically. Relevant to older adult cognition across the dementia spectrum, some cannabinoids, including THC and CBD, have been associated with reduced neuroinflammation, enhanced cholinergic transmission, and reduced beta-amyloid aggregation, with exploratory application in human participants with Alzheimer's disease (Abate et al.\nReference Abate, Uberti and Tambaro 2021\n; Aso &amp; Ferrer,\nReference Aso and Ferrer 2014\n; Bahji et al.\nReference Bahji, Meyyappan and Hawken 2020\n; Weinstein &amp; Sznitman,\nReference Weinstein and Sznitman 2020\n). These findings suggest differential effects of cannabis on cognition and brain health that vary by dose and age.

While SMC is common in older adults and frequently reported by individuals who perform within normal limits on comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation (Crumley et al.\nReference Crumley, Stetler and Horhota 2014\n), SMC has also been shown to be a harbinger of cognitive decline and future diagnosis of MCI and dementia (Lee &amp; Foster,\nReference Lee and Foster 2023\n). Therefore, clarifying the relationship between increased SMC but generally similar objective cognition in older adults who use cannabis is worth further investigation. It remains a commonly held perception that cannabis use of any kind is deleterious to cognition (Carliner et al.\nReference Carliner, Brown, Sarvet and Hasin 2017\n), and this perception may contribute to increased concern for SMC among older adults who use cannabis. As older adults and their medical providers are increasingly considering cannabis to manage chronic health conditions, additional data on the interactive effects across cannabis use patterns, aging trajectories, co-occurring medical conditions, and cognitive status will help inform treatment decisions and manage potential risks.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/862", "#/texts/863", "#/texts/864", "#/texts/865", "#/texts/866", "#/texts/867", "#/texts/868", "#/texts/869", "#/texts/870", "#/texts/871", "#/texts/872", "#/texts/873", "#/texts/874", "#/texts/875", "#/texts/876", "#/texts/877", "#/texts/878"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "243a15d0-da21-42c7-9ae4-08300960681b"}

(\nReference Scott, Brennan and Benitez 2019\n) reviewed 26 studies examining cannabis use and cognitive outcomes in older adults, including participants with normal aging, neurodegenerative diseases, and common medical conditions. Overall, they concluded that \"higher doses and heavier use of cannabis are associated with modest negative effects\" on cognition, while also noting that \"the cognitive deficits associated with heavy, recreational cannabis may not be applicable to medical cannabis users, who may use products with less THC and experience relief from other symptoms, which may contribute to improved cognitive functioning\" (Scott et al.\nReference Scott, Brennan and Benitez 2019\n, p. 452). Our study found no domain-level group difference in cognition (negative or positive) between older adults with and without recent cannabis use. Potentially consistent with Scott et al. (\nReference Scott, Brennan and Benitez 2019\n), our subsample of cannabis users who endorsed elevated risk for CUD demonstrated lower memory performance when compared to cannabis users without increased risk for CUD.

Notably, self-reported difficulty stopping cannabis use (CUDIT-R Item 3) was associated with lower performance across multiple cognitive domains (i.e., speed/executive, visual, language, memory), suggesting that diminished behavioral regulation around cannabis use may reflect broader cognitive vulnerabilities. In contrast, items reflecting frequency of use and cannabis-related memory complaints were more selectively associated with lower memory performance. These findings are consistent with recent work by Anquillare et al. (\nReference Anquillare, Gallegos and Thayer 2023\n), who found that greater cannabis-related problem severity was linked to higher self-reported cognitive failures and reduced cognitive self-efficacy in older adults.

First, like many studies of older adult cannabis use and cognition, several salient details about cannabis use patterns in our sample are unknown. For example, this sample does not include data on historical use patterns (e.g., age of onset, history of substance use disorder), motivational factors (e.g., recreational vs. medical), cannabinoid content (e.g., relative THC vs. CBD), or routes of administration (e.g., gummies, joints, tinctures), each of which may inform the associations between cannabis use and cognitive functioning in older adults. Second, our sample of older adults reporting recent cannabis use is small. Even so, this longitudinal cohort continues with recruitment and annual neuropsychological evaluations. As cannabis-related questions are now part of ongoing data collection and rates of cannabis use continue to rise among older adults, future studies will be positioned to examine within-person changes in cannabis use over time and their potential association with cognitive trajectories. Such longitudinal analyses will provide a more nuanced understanding of the dynamic relationship between cannabis use patterns and cognitive aging. Appropriate data on other substance use variables were not available for inclusion as covariates due to significant variability in data collection timing and response formats in the dataset; future studies will benefit from more robust and standardized assessment of behavioral use patterns across substances. Finally, we were not able to evaluate differential outcomes based on cognitive status or neurocognitive diagnosis due to the currently small sample of those reporting use. Further analysis of differences in cognition according to recent cannabis use within each cognitive phenotype may reveal subgroups that experience different risk/benefit profiles. Despite these limitations, this study advances our currently limited understanding of cannabis use and cognition in older adults by addressing current gaps in the literature and identifying areas for future research.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/899"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "4cd13afe-53ad-49f8-8c84-2bee44b76c27"}

Across the entire group, cognitive functioning was similar between older adults with and without recent cannabis use across five domains of cognition. Among older adults who reported recent use of cannabis, scoring in the hazardous/problematic use range on the CUDIT-R was associated with lower performance on memory tasks. Future research should incorporate detailed assessment of cannabis use patterns and individual characteristics to better understand the nuances of these relationships and potential differences based on cognitive phenotype.\nTable 6.
