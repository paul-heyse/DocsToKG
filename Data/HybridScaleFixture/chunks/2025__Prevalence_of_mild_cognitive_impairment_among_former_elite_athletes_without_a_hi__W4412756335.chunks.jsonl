Although consistent physical activity has been associated with long-term brain health, former elite athletes appear to represent a unique population. While past research has established a connection between sport-related concussions (SRCs) and later cognitive decline, less attention has been given to the cognitive function of former athletes who have not experienced SRCs. Therefore, well-structured cross-sectional studies accounting for established dementia risk factors are needed to compare mild cognitive impairment (MCI) prevalence between former elite athletes and the general population.\nMethods and analysis\nThis cross-sectional study will be conducted at Beijing Sport University (BSU) in Beijing, China. It is designed as a comparative study, aiming to recruit a sample of around 360 participants aged 65 and above. This sample will comprise 180 former elite athletes without a history of SRCs recruited via the BSU Retirement Welfare Office (the former athlete group), and 180 age-matched individuals from the communities in three districts in Beijing (the comparison group). Participants will complete a comprehensive questionnaire covering sociodemographic information, dementia-related risk factors, current physical activity levels and, for the former athlete group specifically, details of their athletic careers. MCI and instrumental activities of daily living will be assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Memtrax continuous recognition test and Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) scale. The primary objective is to determine whether former elite athletes without a history of SRCs have a lower MCI prevalence than the general population. The secondary objective is to assess if these former elite athletes have a reduced prevalence of amnestic MCI and impairment in IADL compared with the general population. Additionally, the study aims to explore whether specific career-related characteristics of former athletes, such as the type of sport and contact exposure, are correlated with their cognitive function and IADL abilities in later life as a secondary exploratory component. The study will calculate the crude prevalence ratios (PRs) and adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) with 95% CIs using the modified Poisson regression model with robust error variance.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/51", "#/texts/52", "#/texts/53", "#/texts/54"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "af15a38c-4a3e-4e91-a22b-87f730d32115"}

Currently known modifiable risk factors for MCI include rural residence, fewer years of education, living alone, smoking and chronic diseases (such as hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes and cerebrovascular disease).\n5\nPhysical activity (PA) is well-established to improve health.\n6-8\nElite athletes, particularly those involved in endurance and mixed sports, may demonstrate exceptional longevity. A recent systematic review has challenged the traditional theory that high-intensity training or competition results in a 'J-shaped' health outcome and has further demonstrated that former athletes generally have longer lifespans and face lower risks of cardiovascular disease and cancer compared with the general population.\n9\nThe outstanding skills demonstrated by elite-level athletes often involve perceptual, cognitive or motor control.\n10 11\nIt is reasonable to assume that engaging in active physical activities or training during youth may contribute to better cognitive health in older individuals compared with those who do not.\n6 12-14\nUnfortunately, robust evidence is lacking regarding the impact of decades-long vigorous PA during athletic careers on late-life cognitive status. Conversely, it is important to note that athletes are more likely to be exposed to the risk of hits and concussions in competition, and the detrimental effects of sport-related concussions (SRCs) on cognitive function can persist for up to several years post-injury.\n15 16\nPrevious studies have predominantly focused on the long-term brain health of former football and rugby players with a history of SRCs. For instance, Baker et al. reported higher depression scores in former professional contact sport athletes than in non-contact athlete controls.\n17\nRussell\net al\nreported a higher incidence of neurodegenerative diseases among rugby players over a 32-year median follow-up.\n18", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/83", "#/texts/84", "#/texts/85", "#/texts/86", "#/texts/87", "#/texts/88", "#/texts/89", "#/texts/90", "#/texts/91", "#/texts/92", "#/texts/93", "#/texts/94", "#/texts/95", "#/texts/96", "#/texts/97", "#/texts/98", "#/texts/99", "#/texts/100", "#/texts/101", "#/texts/102", "#/texts/103", "#/texts/104", "#/texts/105", "#/texts/106"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "523ff8c3-a161-4c42-bff2-c545daccbc2a"}

The existing research findings are inconclusive, warranting separate investigations on the effects of maintaining high PA levels as a protective measure and SRCs as a risk factor. It is also imperative to explore the cognitive function trajectories of former elite athletes further, taking into consideration the details of their athletic careers, such as sport type and contact exposure level.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the cognitive performance of former athletes without a history of SRCs. We hypothesised that former elite athletes without a history of SRCs would exhibit a lower prevalence of MCI in later life and better IADL outcomes compared with their age-matched community-dwelling controls, since their former athletic background could serve as a protective factor. The primary objective is to determine the prevalence of MCI and risk factors in a sample of former elite athletes without a history of SRCs and in an age-matched sample of the general older population in communities with adjustments for known risk factors. The secondary objective is twofold: (1) to compare the prevalence of memory domain impairment and IADL impairment in former elite athletes and the general population and (2) to assess whether the type of sport and contact exposure level in sports may influence the long-term cognitive prognosis of former elite athletes without a history of SRCs as an exploratory investigation.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/107", "#/texts/108"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "e3489ce2-ca3a-4b9e-9e2c-e474cbb323d3"}

Moreover, Beijing Sport University possesses privileged access to former elite athletes, given the specialised nature of this population.\nThe study will enrol participants aged 65 and above, including former elite athletes recruited via the Beijing Sport University Retirement Welfare Office (former athlete group) and age-matched participants from three Beijing districts (Haidian, Fengtai, Changping) (comparison group).

SRCs are defined in accordance with the latest updated conceptual and operational definition. To facilitate comprehension, we will pose the following question before the procedure: 'Have you ever experienced or removed yourself from sports due to symptoms resulting from a direct blow to the head, neck or body resulting in an impulsive force being transmitted to the brain during your athletic career?'.\n20 21", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/111", "#/texts/112", "#/texts/115", "#/texts/116", "#/texts/117", "#/texts/118"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "ac2e4c3b-840b-4000-88e6-e8cf41b4f49f"}

The absence of published data on MCI prevalence among former elite athletes without a history of SRCs precludes standard sample size calculations based on effect size estimation. As this represents the first investigation of MCI in retired elite athletes without a history of SRCs, no prior data exist to reliably estimate the expected effect magnitude. Consequently, the target sample size of 360 participants (180 per group) was determined by feasibility considerations. Given the stringent selection criteria and inherent scarcity of the athlete group, recruiting 180 athletes alongside 180 age-matched controls represents the maximum achievable sample within available resources.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/120", "#/texts/121", "#/texts/122", "#/texts/123", "#/texts/124", "#/texts/126"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "060eaf62-1372-4932-a12d-ec83adedccbd"}

Additionally, a survey on athlete career-related information will be conducted for the former athlete group only (part 4). It is expected that participants will require 20-30\u2009min to complete the questionnaire.\nThe 'identified risk factors' in the current questionnaire derive from a recent extensive epidemiological study involving 46\u2009011 Chinese adults aged 60 years or above. Unmodifiable risk factors include increasing age, female sex and a parental family history, while modifiable factors encompass fewer years of education, living alone, smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes, as well as heart and cerebrovascular disease.\n5\nSince the former elite athletes will be recruited from Beijing Sport University, along with a control group from urban communities in Beijing, the factor of 'residence location' will not be included in the study design. Given the ethnic and environmental variations in risk factors for MCI, we have incorporated additional putative risk factors identified in the Chinese population through the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) and Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (see\ntable 1\n).\nView this table:\n- View inline\n- View popup\nTable 1\nSociodemographic and risk factors (covariates) in current study design", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/133", "#/texts/134", "#/texts/135", "#/texts/136", "#/texts/137", "#/texts/138", "#/texts/139", "#/texts/140", "#/texts/141", "#/texts/142", "#/texts/143"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "e689d167-bf68-4c76-a28a-74a3a5a78117"}

Physical activity (PA)\nThe current PA levels represent an important confounder between the two groups, as exercise behaviours in the general elderly population may independently benefit cognition. In line with the CHARLS study codebook, PA levels will be assessed to ensure consistency with the exercise behaviours commonly practised in Chinese daily routines. The current PA level will be quantified by combining vigorous-intensity PA (VPA), moderate-intensity PA (MPA) and low-intensity PA (LPA) using metabolic equivalent (MET) minutes/week. Various PA levels will be quantified in metabolic equivalent of task (MET) value minutes per week, with VPA, MPA and LPA corresponding to eight METs, four METs and 3.3 METs, respectively. The different levels of PA will be briefly described to facilitate participants' understanding. VPA involves activities that lead to shortness of breath, such as lifting heavy objects, farming, aerobic exercise and fast cycling with cargo. MPA includes activities that increase the breathing rate, like brisk walking, cycling at a normal speed, mopping and tai \u03c7. LPA encompasses activities such as walking at work or home, as well as recreational and leisure walking. In terms of frequency, the range of responses spans from 0 to 7\u2009days per week, with PA frequency segmented into categories of 0 (never), 1-2, 3-5 and 6-7\u2009days per week. Regarding duration, the duration of each PA session will be divided into five levels based on the time spent per day for different PA levels (\n29-31\nConsequently, MET-minutes/week will be categorised into seven groups: 0-599, 600-1199, 1200-1799, 1800-2999, 3000-5999, 6000-8999 and \u22659000 (see\ntable 1\n).", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/154", "#/texts/155", "#/texts/156", "#/texts/157", "#/texts/158"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "97814800-3c99-499b-a974-82a3c05964c9"}

In this study design, trained professionals are responsible for entering participant information. In brief, MemTrax consists of a sequence of 50 images, consisting of 25 new pictures and 25 repetitions, with one image from each of the five categories repeated twice. Participants are instructed to react quickly by touching the screen when a repeated image appears. The completion of the MemTrax test by participants typically takes 2-3\u2009min, with the collection of data on the percentage of correct responses (MTX-%C) and mean response time (MTX-RT). According to a previous study, for differentiating MCI-AD from controls, an optimised MTX-%C cut-off is 81%.\n47\n\nPrevalence of mild cognitive impairment among former elite athletes without a history of sport-related concussions compared to the general older population: a protocol for a cross-sectional study with exploratory subgroup analyses | BMJ Open\nMethods/design\nCognitive and neuropsychological tests\nLawton instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) scale\nThe evaluation of individuals' functional abilities across eight domains, such as telephone use, laundry and financial management, will be conducted using the IADL.\n48\nThis assessment can be swiftly administered in approximately 10\u2009min. It yields a summary score ranging from 0 (reflecting low function and dependence) to 8 (reflecting high function and independence) for women.

This study is valuable since it is the first cross-sectional study protocol comparing the risk of MCI in former elite athletes without a history of SRCs and the general population, with the ultimate goal of determining whether former elite athletic careers have a lifespan brain health advantage. Our hypothesis posits that, after adjusting for identified risk factors and current levels of PA, former elite athletes without SRCs would exhibit superior cognitive function compared with the general population. This implies that VPA and specialised training during their adolescence and youth may have a significant impact on the athletes' cognitive trajectory.\nAnother strength of this study is the use of Memtrax, a quantitative evaluation tool, to supplement the questionnaire-based MCI assessment. A recent study conducted in 2021 demonstrated that MemTrax could effectively and accurately detect clinically diagnosed MCI better than MoCA in a Chinese cohort. Neurodegenerative conditions, including AD, have been observed in elite athletes who have engaged in contact sports and sustained SRCs. However, the prevalence of aMCI in elite athletes without a history of SRCs has received little attention. Our study will present preliminary findings to describe memory-related cognition and IADL changes in this population.

Even though the participants did not have a history of SRCs, the physical strains of contact sports activities, such as sprinting, kicking and shovelling, may result in repeated bodily impacts. Thus, it is crucial to assess the impact of contact and non-contact sports, as well as different sport types, on the cognitive abilities of former elite athletes separately. In this study, the term 'exploratory' strictly applies to the sport-specific subgroup analyses (eg, endurance vs power sports; contact exposure levels). These analyses are exploratory due to the insufficient statistical power from stratified sample sizes. The practical importance of this study lies in its potential for enhancing empirical evidence in the field of sports for health.

First, the cross-sectional nature of the study precludes establishing a causal relationship between an athletic career and a reduced incidence of MCI in later life. Second, the relatively modest sample size-dictated by the scarcity of former elite athletes and lack of published data on MCI prevalence among former elite athletes without sports-related concussions-precluded standard sample size calculations based on effect size estimation. Consequently, while the modified Poisson regression provides robust PR estimates, the precision of effect measures (particularly subgroup analyses) requires cautious interpretation. Third, the information collection included self-reported recall regarding factors such as a history of SRCs and a parental history of dementia. This approach may introduce bias due to inaccuracies in recalled information or subjectivity in responses. Moreover, potential undiagnosed health conditions that could influence MCI among participants could not be captured. Finally, previous research has identified cognitive decline in former athletes from sports such as rugby, soccer and football. However, given the actual prevalence of these sports in China, where basketball, table tennis and badminton are more popular, it hinders comprehensive understanding of MCI in former elite athletes worldwide. Thus, regional and selection biases should be anticipated due to variations in the prevalence of MCI among former elite athletes without SRCs across countries. These variations may be influenced by differences in sport popularity, post-career trajectories and access to social benefits such as medical risk screenings.\nIn summary, this cross-sectional study design prevents the establishment of definitive conclusions regarding whether former athletic careers are better protected against cognitive decline in terms of cognitive trajectory. Future research should include cohort studies and randomised controlled trials to address this gap. Given the intricate interplay among genetic, environmental and developmental factors in relation to athletic careers, as well as the subsequent cognitive trajectories post-retirement, research could be enhanced through more extensive databases. Prospective research endeavours should also be pursued.\n\nPrevalence of mild cognitive impairment among former elite athletes without a history of sport-related concussions compared to the general older population: a protocol for a cross-sectional study with exploratory subgroup analyses | BMJ Open\nEthics statements\nPatient consent for publication\nConsent obtained directly from patient(s).", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/224", "#/texts/225", "#/texts/228"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "7824dd85-41ff-413b-9d50-0d8ba55736f2"}
