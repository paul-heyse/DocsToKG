The aim of this study is to develop and validate machine learning (ML) models based on non-imaging features to predict the risk of MCI conversion in cognitively healthy older adults over a three-year period. Using data from 845 participants aged 65 to 87 years, we built five eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) models of increasing complexity, incorporating demographic, self-reported, medical, and cognitive variables. The models were trained and evaluated using robust preprocessing techniques, including multiple imputation for missing data, Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) for class balancing, and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) for interpretability. Model performance improved with the inclusion of cognitive assessments, with the most comprehensive model (Model 5) achieving the highest accuracy (86%) and area under the curve (AUC\u2009=\u20090.8359). Feature importance analysis revealed that variables such as memory tests, depressive symptoms, and age were significant predictors of MCI conversion. In addition, an online risk calculator has been developed and made available free of charge to facilitate clinical use and provide a practical, cost-effective tool for early detection in diverse healthcare settings (\nhttps://aimar-project.shinyapps.io/MCI-risk-calculator/\n). This study highlights the potential of non-imaging ML models for early detection of MCI and emphasizes their accessibility and clinical utility. Future research should focus on validating these models in different populations and examining their integration with personalized intervention strategies to reduce dementia risk.\n\nXGBoost models based on non imaging features for the prediction of mild cognitive impairment in older adults\nAbstract\nDifferential diagnosis of neurodegenerative dementias with the explainable MRI based machine learning algorithm MUQUBIA\nArticle\nOpen access\n13 October 2023\n\nXGBoost models based on non imaging features for the prediction of mild cognitive impairment in older adults\nAbstract\nA multimodal machine learning model for predicting dementia conversion in Alzheimer's disease\nArticle\nOpen access\n29 May 2024\n\nXGBoost models based on non imaging features for the prediction of mild cognitive impairment in older adults\nAbstract\nCognitive performance classification of older patients using machine learning and electronic medical records\nArticle\nOpen access\n24 February 2025", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/52", "#/texts/53", "#/texts/54", "#/texts/57", "#/texts/58", "#/texts/59", "#/texts/61", "#/texts/62", "#/texts/63", "#/texts/65", "#/texts/66", "#/texts/67"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "0480e5b3-06ed-45f4-bb7b-3711c281a1dc"}

According to the United Nations (2020), the number of people aged 65 years or older is expected to double from 703 million in 2019 to over 1.5 billion in 2050\n1\n, representing a growing portion of the population vulnerable to age-related diseases, including dementia, and in particular Alzheimer's disease (AD). Dementia affects millions of individuals worldwide, leading to significant cognitive decline and impacting daily functioning and quality of life\n2\n. It not only causes a progressive and irreversible deterioration of the patient's mental faculties but is also the leading cause of dependency and, collaterally, represents a substantial economic, social, and personal cost. Its prevalence is expected to rise substantially, with estimates suggesting that the number of people with dementia will triple in the next 30 years, from 50 million to 152 million by 2050\n3\n. The situation is even more concerning considering that this type of dementia does not appear to be reversible once diagnosed, and there have been no truly significant scientific advances in this regard for over 20 years. However, the onset of dementia does not occur suddenly; on the contrary, the initial pathophysiological and cognitive changes associated with dementia, although subtle, can be observed up to two decades before clinical diagnosis in the absence of clearly perceptible symptoms\n4\n,\n5\n. Therefore, there is a large window of time in which it is possible to identify individuals at risk of future dementia and then subject them to personalized prevention programs. The problem is that there are currently no accurate tools for early detection of these individuals in preclinical stages. It is precisely these pre-dementia stages that are of utmost importance. Implementing effective therapeutic interventions at these stages could potentially halt or even reverse disease progression\n6\n.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/69", "#/texts/70", "#/texts/71", "#/texts/72", "#/texts/73", "#/texts/74", "#/texts/75", "#/texts/76", "#/texts/77", "#/texts/78", "#/texts/79", "#/texts/80", "#/texts/81"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "73b72e55-0374-48fe-a92a-55120b13ee03"}

Precisely, the Lancet Commission on Dementia Prevention, Intervention, and Care has been studying this issue in the last years. Since its inception in 2017, the Commission has assessed evidence related to potentially modifiable dementia risk factors, synthesizing scientific data from various meta-analyses and intervention studies. So, the 2017 report found the potential for dementia risk reduction by addressing twelve established risk factors across the lifespan: low education, hearing loss, hypertension, smoking, obesity, depression, physical inactivity, diabetes, excessive alcohol consumption, traumatic brain injury, air pollution, and social isolation\n7\n. The recent 2024 report reaffirms the role of the previously identified risk factors and adds two more: midlife elevated LDL cholesterol and untreated vision loss\n8\n. This finding means that through a combination of factors, it would be possible to identify individuals at high risk of developing dementia very early. This combination of factors could be non-linear and, therefore, not intuitive. For example, unlike in younger age groups, from the age of 85, elevated levels of hemoglobin A1c\n9\ncholesterol\n10\nor homocysteine\n11\nare associated with a lower risk of dementia. Thus, to unravel the role and actual weight of each factor in the onset of dementia, computational techniques based on artificial intelligence (AI) should be used, as they allow for handling massive data and developing dynamic algorithms that help trace personalized evolutionary trajectories\n12\n.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/82", "#/texts/83", "#/texts/84", "#/texts/85", "#/texts/86", "#/texts/87", "#/texts/88", "#/texts/89", "#/texts/90", "#/texts/91", "#/texts/92", "#/texts/93", "#/texts/94"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "25e0cc12-cfe6-4a1b-bb20-4969863bcd5d"}

ML has emerged as a powerful tool in medical diagnostics, offering the potential to analyze complex datasets and identify patterns that may not be apparent to human observers. In the context of dementia diagnosis, ML algorithms can be trained on large datasets containing demographic, cognitive, socioeconomic, clinical information, lifestyles, and neuroimaging to identify patterns indicative of dementia and develop predictive models. By leveraging ML, it is possible to develop diagnostic tools that are not only accurate but also cost-effective and easily integrated into clinical practice to enable early intervention in dementia\n13\n. In fact, in the last few years, several studies have been published that build predictive models using AI and ML to identify individuals at high risk of dementia. These risk prediction models have been developed primarily based on a combination of cognitive test scores, sociodemographic, health, lifestyle, and environmental variables, with varying levels of accuracy in distinguishing outcomes\n14\n. For example, Barnes et al. (2009) developed one of the first models to consider a late-life dementia risk index\n15\n. The model used logistic regression on 3,375 subjects and features such as demographics, cognition, physical activity, neuroimaging, social behavior, among others, to identify individuals at risk of dementia within six years. Exalto et al. (2013) reported a Cox proportional hazards model using a combination of 45 predictors from self-reported data, medication, laboratory data, and clinical histories in a cohort of 29,961 individuals with type 2 diabetes for a 10-year dementia risk\n16\n. Nori et al. (2019) used ML with a large dataset including over 10,000 features to predict 5-year dementia risk\n17\n. A more recent model presented a multi-diagnostic approach using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ML to diagnose mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD\n18\n. The researchers used data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS), training classifiers, such as support vector machines (SVMs) and neural networks. The classifiers demonstrated high accuracy, with the \"healthy controls (HC) vs. AD\" classifier achieving a balanced accuracy of 90.6%.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/95", "#/texts/96", "#/texts/97", "#/texts/98", "#/texts/99", "#/texts/100", "#/texts/101", "#/texts/102", "#/texts/103", "#/texts/104", "#/texts/105", "#/texts/106", "#/texts/107"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "d6c162ee-f989-4c10-8869-55e5d37dc05e"}

In addition, another weakness is that it may not be possible to collect a large set of variables for each patient, which usually include MRIs, cognitive tests, self-reported data, laboratory results, etc. A final limitation is that most ML algorithms rely on imaging techniques such as MRI and positron emission tomography (PET), which may not be readily available to physicians, especially in primary care. On the contrary, incorporating non-imaging features such as demographic information, cognitive test results, clinical history and lifestyles are often easier and less expensive to collect compared to imaging data, although the relationship between all of these features is not yet fully understood.\n\nXGBoost models based on non imaging features for the prediction of mild cognitive impairment in older adults\nObjectives of our study\nThe main goal of the study was to develop ML models to predict MCI in people over 65 years of age over a three-year period. For this purpose, only non-imaging features such as demographic, clinical and cognitive variables as well as lifestyle data were analyzed. All of this data can be collected relatively easily through a short clinical interview and the use of specific cognitive tests. A total of five prediction models were developed, which included a smaller or larger number of variables depending on the ease of collecting information.\nThe specific objectives were:\n1. 1. To identify the most relevant features for MCI diagnosis.\n2. 2. To develop and train five ML models using these features.\n3. 3. To evaluate the performance of the models using multiple metrics and selecting the best hyperparameters.\n4. 4. To implement the most powerful models as an online diagnostic tool and make them available to primary and specialized healthcare professionals to assist them in data-driven clinical decision-making.\nDeveloping an online ML diagnostic tool for MCI offers several potential benefits for physicians. First, it can improve the accessibility and affordability of early dementia diagnosis, particularly in low-resource settings. Second, it can facilitate early intervention and management, potentially slowing the progression of the disease and improving patient outcomes. Finally, it can reduce the burden on healthcare systems by enabling more efficient and cost-effective screening and diagnosis.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/108", "#/texts/110", "#/texts/111", "#/texts/112", "#/texts/113", "#/texts/114", "#/texts/115", "#/texts/116"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "00bcb98a-f5dd-4c5f-af0d-82da4f293a02"}

The main goal of the two projects was to both improve the early detection and prevention of MCI and dementia and to increase knowledge about the determinants of healthy aging\n19\n.\nAfter signing the informed consent, all participants underwent a detailed assessment protocol, which was usually completed within four hours with appropriate breaks. The full assessment included a clinical semi-structured interview and a neurological and neuropsychological examination. Therefore, our dataset contains information on a variety of variables grouped in five categories (Supplementary Table\nS1\n): Sociodemographic, Self-reported from a clinical interview, Medical examination, and Cognitive assessment.\nThe participants were followed for three years. Clinical diagnoses were always agreed upon in consensus discussions between neurologists and neuropsychologists. When available, MRIs were considered to exclude the presence of macroscopic lesions or significant vascular damage. Each participant was then independently diagnosed after each visit based on their age, gender, cognitive reserve, functional information, and cognitive scores. However, the diagnoses were not based on psychometrically stable thresholds values, but rather on clinical impressions. The NIA-AA's criteria were used to diagnose core MCI\n20\nwhich included: (i) self- or informant-reported cognitive complaints; (ii) objective evidence of impairment in one or more cognitive domains; (iii) preserved independence in functional abilities; and (iv) not demented.

A methodology was used to clean and prepare the features, which included the identification of numerical and categorical variables. We then conducted a preliminary analysis of the baseline data to find out their distribution and examine the nature and distribution of missing values. Then, we performed a multiple imputation procedure under a fully conditional specification method to impute values that are as close as possible to the ideal predicted observations. These imputed values were generated based on existing variables. The imputation procedure replaced each missing observation with a set of plausible values representing the uncertainty about the appropriate value to be imputed. The process was repeated five times, yielding the corresponding five data sets, the coefficients of which varied from set to set. The imputed data sets were analyzed using the usual full data procedure. Distributions of imputed and observed values were compared using density plots, showing similar patterns across all variables. Convergence was monitored across \u2212\u200920 iterations and confirmed using a convergence threshold of 1e-4. In addition, a sensitivity analysis comparing results across different imputation models showed comparable conclusions, supporting the robustness of our approach. Finally, the results of these analyses were combined to draw valid statistical inferences of the data. The\nmice\npackage for R was used to perform the multiple imputation procedure\n26\n.

It is based on the principle of boosting, a technique that combines multiple weak models (in this case, decision trees) to create a stronger model\n21\n. The key idea is to sequentially add trees to the model, where each new tree aims to correct the errors made by the previous trees. This iterative process continues until a specified number of trees are added or the model's performance stops improving.

Initially it was considered appropriate to design predictive models based on the potential availability of necessary information. Some features can be easily and directly obtained from a basic clinical interview conducted by any healthcare professional.

The process began with an initial data split of 80-20 for training and testing sets, respectively. Within the training phase, we implemented 5-fold cross-validation to ensure robust performance estimation during hyperparameter optimization. Our optimization strategy focused on six key hyperparameters selected for their significant impact on model complexity and generalization ability: maximum depth (ranging from 3 to 10), learning rate (between 0.01 and 0.3), gamma (from 0 to 0.2), column sampling ratio (between 0.6 and 1.0), minimum child weight (from 1 to 10), and subsample ratios (between 0.6 and 1.0).\nThe Bayesian optimization process consisted of 20 total iterations, beginning with an exploration phase of 10 random configurations to establish a baseline understanding of the hyperparameter space. The subsequent optimization phase was guided by the \"expected improvement\" acquisition function, systematically exploring promising regions of the parameter space. The objective function implementation used 'binary: logistic' with AUC as the evaluation metric, returning the maximum AUC score achieved during cross-validation for each parameter combination evaluated.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/182", "#/texts/183", "#/texts/184", "#/texts/185", "#/texts/186"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "362918ee-6173-48b8-afa3-2e76cf61112d"}

Family history of AD also maintained consistent importance across models, suggesting its value as an early screening indicator.\nBuilding upon these foundational indicators, our analysis revealed that certain self-reported clinical parameters showed model-specific importance (hyperlipidemia in Model 1, hypertension in Model 2, diabetes in Model 4).

The successful implementation of an online risk calculator provides a practical solution for clinicians. By relying exclusively on non-imaging features, the calculator overcomes the cost, accessibility, and infrastructure barriers typically associated with neuroimaging-based approaches. In particular, the availability of simpler models (e.g., Model 1) broadens the accessibility of these tools to primary care settings, where cognitive assessments or specialized medical equipment may not be readily available. However, the incorporation of cognitive variables in Models 3-5significantly enhances predictive accuracy, making them more suitable for specialized settings or when cognitive testing can be performed.

The psychological impact of early MCI diagnosis demands careful handling of both positive and negative predictions, necessitating clear protocols for result communication and appropriate support systems. Furthermore, ensuring fairness across different demographic groups is paramount, requiring regular validation to prevent potential healthcare disparities and maintain trust in clinical settings.\nFrom a data protection perspective, the implementation of these predictive models demands a comprehensive framework that addresses both privacy concerns and practical clinical integration. This includes robust security protocols for data transmission and storage, strict adherence to GDPR and HIPAA requirements, and clear procedures for data retention and deletion. The successful integration of these models in clinical practice requires maintaining a balance between algorithmic predictions and human oversight, ensuring that AI augments rather than replaces clinical judgment.

First, the study cohort was derived from two datasets in Madrid, Spain, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to other populations. Validation in diverse cohorts and geographic regions is essential to ensure broader applicability. To address the inherent geographical limitations of our current dataset, we are planning a comprehensive validation strategy to address this concern that will involve two parallel approaches: first, external retrospective validation using established international longitudinal databases (such as the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) and the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE)) that contain equivalent variables to those in our study; and second, clinical prospective validation using patient data from multiple Spanish medical centers. This dual validation approach will enable both model refinement through new data incorporation and verification of generalizability across diverse populations. This systematic validation process will strengthen the robustness and broader applicability of our predictive models across different geographical and demographic contexts.\nSecond, while our models demonstrate strong predictive performance within a three-year window, we acknowledge that this follow-up period may not fully capture the progression of cognitive decline, particularly in individuals with slower disease trajectories. Longer follow-up periods could provide valuable insights into different progression patterns and potentially improve the calibration and predictive performance of our models. This limitation highlights the importance of future longitudinal studies with extended follow-up periods to validate and refine these predictive tools.\nFinally, while our models incorporating cognitive assessments demonstrate superior predictive performance, we acknowledge the potential implementation challenges these assessments may present in various clinical settings. To address this limitation, we have developed a flexible, multi-tiered approach that accommodates different levels of assessment capability. For settings where comprehensive cognitive testing may not be feasible such as primary care, our simpler models (Models 1 and 2) provide reliable predictive performance using readily available clinical and demographic data. In any event, several emerging alternatives could complement or enhance traditional cognitive assessments in future iterations of these models.

First, cognitive features were found to be the dominant predictors, particularly those assessing memory, which emphasizes their critical role in predicting MCI conversion. Second, there is also an interplay of demographic, self-reported, and medical factors, particularly in simpler models. This interplay suggests that while cognitive decline is central to MCI, other factors such as age, depression, cognitive complaints, family history of AD, and cardiovascular health significantly contribute to risk stratification.\nAccording to Livingston et al. (2024), 45% of future dementia cases could potentially be prevented if the 14 risk factors identified by the Lancet Commission on Dementia Prevention, Intervention, and Care were eliminated\n8\n. This emphasizes the need to integrate machine learning frameworks, such as the one developed in this study, into public health initiatives aimed at reducing modifiable risk factors. Future research should explore how predictive models can be combined with personalized interventions to mitigate these risks at an individual level. Furthermore, the development of user-friendly tools, such as the online calculator proposed in this work, will facilitate the practical application of advanced algorithms, empowering healthcare professionals and policymakers to make data-driven decisions. Expanding the dataset to include diverse populations and longitudinal outcomes beyond three years could enhance the generalizability and robustness of predictive models. Extended follow-up studies could enable the development of more sophisticated time-dependent models capable of predicting cognitive decline across various timeframes. Such models could potentially be calibrated to provide predictions for different temporal horizons (e.g., 3-year, 5-year, and 10-year risk), offering clinicians more comprehensive prognostic information. Additionally, longer follow-up periods would allow for the development of dynamic prediction models that could be updated as new patient data becomes available, potentially improving the accuracy and clinical utility of the predictions over time.
