The major frequent cause of dementia is AD, with an estimated 50 million or more individuals affected globally, these days.

The variants can influence the levels of BIN1 or splicing between isoforms, especially the distribution of isoforms. In AD, there is a significant change in expression of BIN1 isoforms, where there is an upregulation of shorter glial-specific isoforms and a downregulation of longer neuronal isoforms.

Heritability estimates for AD range from 59% to 78%, and the risk of the disease is influenced by genetic susceptibility at several loci and interactions among these genes [\n2\n]. The sole unquestionably documented susceptibility genes for early onset familial AD have long been amyloid precursor protein (APP) and the presenilin genes 1 and 2 (PSEN1, PSEN2), while apolipoprotein E (APOE) is the only susceptibility gene that has been proven for common late onset AD (LOAD). In addition to APOE4, nine more genes/loci have been found recently through extensive genome-wide association studies (GWAS) [\n3\n,\n4\n,\n5\n]. Extensive genome-wide correlation additional common variations linked to AD susceptibility have been found and replicated by investigation. These variants include\nBIN1\n, CR1, CLU, CD33, CD2AP, ABCA7, EPHA1, PICALIM, MS4A4A, and MD4A6A. The list is further expanded to include HLA-DRB5, SORL1, PTK2B, SLC24A4, INPP5D, DSG2, NME8, MEF2C, ZCWPW1, FERMT2, CELF1 and CASS4 in the most recent meta-analysis [\n6\n] to the date (with about 75,000 individuals). The risk of AD is associated with an uncommon variation in TREM2 [\n7\n,\n8\n]. Furthermore, AD is linked to a significant amplification of hexanucleotide repeats in C9oborf72 [\n9\n]. APOE has an important role in the metabolism of lipids and in repairing the damaged neurons of the central nervous system [\n10\n]. E2, E3, E4 are the most common isomers of APOE.

Perikarya, dendrites, and axons have all been found to contain the aberrant filaments that make up NFT. These filaments, which have been named \"paired Helical Filaments,\" (PHF), have been described as two filaments helicoidally twisted around one another [\n40\n]. They appear straight or exhibit regular constrictions. The microtubule-associated protein tau has been identified as the primary component of PHF, and a reliable and repeatable technique for detecting NFT is immunocytochemical labeling with anti-tau antibodies [\n41\n,\n42\n]. The first indications regarding the protein composition of PHF came from immunocytochemical studies, which also showed cytoskeletal proteins are connected to in situ and post-isolation processes. PHF and antibodies generated to isolate PHF fraction tau proteins have been shown to exhibit immunoreactivity for the microtubule-associated protein tau on a regular basis [\n43\n,\n44\n,\n45\n,\n46\n,\n47\n].

Additionally, ubiquitin has been immunocytochemically identified in a subset of PHF. It consists of a 76-amino acid polypeptide that is engaged in a variety of non-lysosomal, ATP-dependent proteolytic processes [\n49\n].

Tau is present in the adult human brain in six different isoforms, with amino acid values ranging from 352 to 441, which are produced by the alternative splicing of single mRNA that is transcribed from a gene found on chromosome 17 [\n74\n]. Tau is highly expressed in neurons, but it is also present in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Tau is found throughout the entire cell in developing neurons [\n75\n]. Despite the fact that the somatodendritic domain contains the pool of phosphorylated tau, it is concentrated in axons in mature neurons [\n76\n,\n77\n,\n78\n]. Highly phosphorylated tau is mislocalized to the synaptic compartments in AD, where it mediates synaptotoxicity and impairs synapse function [\n79\n,\n80\n,\n81\n,\n82\n]. The brain of an individual with advanced AD has less of the longest neuronal\nBIN1\nprotein isoform [\n83\n]. In comparison with controls, tau phosphorylated at S396/S404 was observed to build up at the synapses in both moderate and several phases of AD. The loss of cytoplasmic tau was accompanied by an accumulation of synaptic tau, indicating that reflect tau was missorted from the cytoplasm to the synapses. In both severe and moderate AD tissues, we discovered notable and substantial losses of cytoplasmic\nBIN1\n, which correlated inversely with increases in synaptic tau and positively with decreases in cytoplasmic tau. Additionally, it has been discovered that the phosphorylated (pSer396/404, PHF 1)\nBIN1\nand tau levels in the cytoplasmic fraction correlated negatively. Additionally, there was no discernible relationship between the amounts of\nBIN1\nin the total or synaptoneurosome fractions and either total or phosphorylated tau.

One trait linked to AD amyloid pathology was the abnormal build-up of BIN1 protein. Regarding tau-related pathology, it has been observed that elevated expression of the BIN1 protein intensifies tau-related pathology by directly binding to a proline-rich domain in tau through the SH3 domain, in addition to altering the endocytosis of tau protein.
