Disease management along with effective intervention depends on the detailed diagnosis conducted early. The proposed framework builds an ensemble system from ResNet-50 and EfficientNet-B3 to conduct automated AD diagnostics by processing high-resolution Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images. The proposed model uses ResNet-50 to extract features coupled with EfficientNet-B3 as its robust classifier which achieves high accuracy alongside generalization performance. A large, high-quality dataset comprising 33,984 MRI images was used, ensuring diverse representation of different disease stages: the study included participants with four dementia stages organized as Mild, Moderate, Non-demented, and Very Mild Demented. The research applied several comprehensive data preprocessing methods combining normalization steps with rescaling algorithms alongside noise elimination techniques to achieve enhanced performance. Performance tests on the model required examination of accuracy along with precision and recall metrics and F1-score and ROC curve area measurements. The ensemble model delivered remarkable overall accuracy reaching 99.32% while surpassing separate deep learning architectures. The confusion matrix evaluation results showed superb classification results for Mild and Moderate stages along with non-dementia cases while maintaining minimal Wrong choices in Very Mild Demented cases. Experimental findings demonstrate the strength of deep learning algorithms to detect AD disease stages accurately. The robust and accurate performance of the proposed model indicates it has potential for use in medical environments to support radiologists in their work of early-stage AD screening and treatment development. Additional research in diverse clinical environments will strive to optimize and validate the model so it can meet real-world diagnostic requirements for medical use.\nKEYWORDS\nAlzheimer's disease, neurodegenerative disorder, deep learning, MRI analysis, ResNet50, EfficientNet-B3, ensemble model, feature extraction", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/20", "#/texts/21", "#/texts/22"], "page_nos": [1], "uuid": "8da9c2a1-adf1-4997-bb6f-49e2b892adf6"}

The disease is defined clinically by the deposit of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brains, leading to the gradual decline in brain volume, and resulting in confusion, poor judgement, language disorder, personality changes, and the inability to carry out activities of daily living (1). To date, aging is still the biggest risk factor for developing AD, but there are also genetic factors, unhealthy life styles, cardiovascular diseases and physical environments that affect the development as well as the progress of AD (2). To date, there is no known cure for Alzheimer's disease but major advancements in medical research have provided methods of managing the disease, these include; cholinesterase inhibitors, memantine, health and safety promotion through changes in diets and coming up with strict exercise regimes that can reduce deterioration of the patient's condition (3). Prior to the publication of DSM IV-Tre quantitative diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease primarily depended on clinical assessment, patient history, and neuropsychological assessment that even though still today have their utility, were reported to provide low sensitivity in early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease as well as being time consuming and labor intensive. Also, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and PET scans have been used to detect abnormalities in the brains of mentally ill patients, although these approaches lack high accuracy when no computational tools are applied (4). Over the last few years, the incorporation of deep learning methods in medical imaging has definitely advanced diagnosis, particularly for Alzheimer's disease as a more precise, fast, and less error-prone approach (5).", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/26"], "page_nos": [1], "uuid": "6cdb9466-ae88-41b5-9e98-308ddf720d26"}

In the context of Alzheimer's disease, the required diagnostic tools are significantly more diverse and refined; this is why ensemble deep learning models have recently become popular as they unite the results of several architectures in one model (6). As for the CNN model selection, two advanced structures including ResNet50 and EfficientNet-B3 have become the most popular pro forma architectures in recent years due to the higher image classification performance. The vanishing gradient problem is solved through using the ResNet architecture of a deep residual network of 50 layers; deeper networks converge well while capturing details of the images at the same time (7, 8). On the other hand, EfficientNetB3 uses compound scaling method to control the network depth, width, and so on, making it highly efficient and accurate to extract features with little computational need. Thus, the ensemble of ResNet-50 and EfficientNet-B3 models, where the weaknesses of each of them are masked, and the strengths are combined, contributes to increasing the efficiency of diagnostics compared to using only such architectures and increases the robustness when detecting subtle abnormalities in MRI scans.

This approach operates in an attempt to overcome the recognized deficiencies of conventional diagnostic check techniques for AD through the development of an efficient diagnosis system that would be automated, accurate, and fairly easy to implement in the different human populations at the various stages of the disease development (9). In addition, the problem statement focuses on the requirement of an accurate diagnostic tool to differentiate between distinct phases of Alzheimer's disease with robust performance, despite data imbalance, MRI scan noise, and variation (10). Therefore, the major contributions of this study are the development of an ensemble model that comprises ResNet-50 and EfficientNet-B3, an assessment of the performance of the proposed ensemble model against existing deep learning architectures, and a proof of the usefulness of the suggested model in enhancing the diagnostic accuracy of Alzheimer's disease classification. Several works have been extensively conducted on AD detection using standalone CNNs, CNNs with Attention Mechanisms, Ensemble of CNNs and the hybrid of them; their performance is sometimes constrained by a limited number of available diagnostic samples, non-normative database information, and high computational costs (4, 8). For example, Ajagbe et al. (3) and Shirbandi et al. (6) pointed out that applying CNN-based models in MRI-based classification is promising; however, that architectures should be improved to learn deeper and abstract features. Finally, the studies by Sorour et al. (8) and Mujahid et al. (7) showed that the setup based on the ensemble learning is extremely valuable for the detection of AD, as the results of multiple models enhanced positive prediction and diminished the numbers of false-positives. Thus, basing on these achievements, the development of our proposed model is intended to fill the gap in the identified scientific studies and integrate the advantages of ResNet-50 and EfficientNet-B3, including their residual learning ability and computational efficiency. Furthermore, the given work uses techniques like data augmentation and employs adaptive learning to deal with issues that are hard to solve for, including overfitting and imbalance, in order to have a high model accuracy on various MRI datasets (7).

Based on its deep residual connections which allow the model to learn complex features, ResNet-50 is well-suited to this task, whereas EfficientNet-B3 which incorporates optimized scaling for efficient computations is equally efficient and accurate for the task at hand. This combination is specifically advantageous for medical imaging applications where the minor differences have to be identified between the structures of normal brains and that of the AD patients (6). Moreover, ensemble learning is beneficial in increasing the generalizability of the model, since the combination of more predictions means decreasing the model bias and variance and thus, increasing the diagnostic reliability (7). Finally, this paper intends to make a positive contribution to the available body of knowledge on Alzheimer's disease by proposing a new, yet highly effective, deep learning structure that encompasses the best facets of the ensemble learning technique to deliver the highest possible\ndiagnostic accuracy. Of critical value and practical applicability, the proposed model can help clinicians make quick and precise diagnosis decisions, which will lead to earlier diagnosis, target treatment plans, and enhanced patient care (2, 8).\nIn this context, this study contributes to fill the gap of the current diagnostic techniques in Alzheimer ' s disease and to establish the base for future studies that will promote the creation of new, available and reliable tools with deep learning for Alzheimer ' s disease diagnosis in magnetic resonance images. This work couples two important elements for the construction of an effective diagnostic test for Alzheimer ' s disease based on high classification accuracy and explainability. Section 2 gives an extensive literature review of the existing diagnostic conventional approaches, deep learning in neuroimaging. Next, in Section 3, the method is described, more specifically, details about the dataset, the preprocessing of MRI scans, the architecture of the proposed ensemble model based on ResNet-50 and Efficient Net B3. In Section 4, the authors report the findings analyzing the effectiveness of the ensemble model and taking them up against the other classification models.

The two best performing deep learners in this study are the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), specifically ResNet-50 and EfficientNet-B3 reveal promising features for efficient AD diagnosis from brain MRI scans. The subjects of Raza et al. ' s (11) study involved segmentation and classification of MRI images of Alzheimer ' s disease employing transfer learning (TL) and proposed particular CNNs. The approach works on images that segment objects as divided by the brain ' s Gray Matter. Rather than training from the ground up, there existed a pre-trained deep learning model, to which the process proceeded as transfer learning. The model was compared at 10, 25, and 50 epochs and the mean accuracy was found to be 97.84%. Ironically, transfer learning and segmentation techniques stand as prominent methodologies in a comprehensive framework of medical imaging analysis in diagnosing Alzheimer ' s disease this study shows the enhancement of accuracy (11). Sharma et al. presents a machine learning model based on transfer learning (TL) and permutation-based voting classifiers for Alzheimer ' s detection from MRI images. DenseNet-121 and DenseNet-201 extract features in phase one and phase two has classifiers such as support vector machine, Na\u00efve Bayes and XGBoost to classify.

Mentioned results are completely compatible with the statements and show the higher effectiveness of the offered model compared with state-of-the-art methods; thus, there is perspective to consider the proposed model for usage in clinician applications for Alzheimer ' s disease identification (12). The authors Zhang, Zhang, Du, and Wang (13) in their study proposed an enhanced neural network known as ADNet from the VGG-16 model for detection of Alzheimer ' s diseases applying 2D MRI slices. Those modifications consist of depthwise separable convolution to decrease the number of parameters; however, the model uses ELU activation to avoid the problem of exploding gradients; the model also incorporated an SE module for effective feature recalibration. Similarly, training is combined with auxiliary tasks: regression of clinical dementia and mental state score. Experimental results proved that the proposed approach gives 4.18% higher accuracy of AD compared with cognitively normal (CN) and 6% of MCI accuracy compared with CN than the VGG16 model. These outcomes indicate that multitask learning solutions and better architecture for the neural network may help ADNet to support early Alzheimer ' s detection. Solano et al.

Focusing on the ability to produce replicable results, the approach uses only the tools available freely online, which means it should be more easily implemented in poorer countries as well. This approach helps to show that deep learning is useful in medical diagnosis and the equitable distribution of technology for installation and use. Carcagni et al.

In particular, the study utilizes deep learning methods in improving the detection accuracy and speed of Alzheimer ' s disease, through exploiting the features of CNN, through a feature extraction step and exploiting self-attention to learn the long-range dependencies.

Deep learning has emerged as an essential element of genomic analysis because of its capability to handle large genomic data by identifying the diverse relationships between them. Progress includes the following new trends in models: model architecture, model development philosophies, and model interpretation techniques for estimating the effects of genetic variants on disease progression. This review shows how to incorporate genomic deep learning methods into disease-specific models with an emphasis on neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer ' s. It focuses on Alzheimer ' s literature and where it identifies more general methodological approaches, it explores their suitability. In addition, Qui et al. have discussed directions for future work involving neurodegeneration genomics, and deep learning (17). Hazarika et al. compares different deep learning (DL) models in AD classification using brain Magnetic Resonance (MR) images collected from the Alzheimer ' s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. However, the DenseNet-121 model showed the highest accuracy of 88.78%, a bit slower than the others because of the extensive convolutions. Thus, to overcome this kind of limitation, the authors suggested a new DenseNet-121 structure, where instead of the conventional convolutional layers, the depthwise convolutional layers should be used. These optimizations improved computational and accuracy rates making the based accuracy to be 90.22%. The results discussed above imply future possibilities of depth-wise convolution in enhancing the DL-based AD classification models (18). In their paper, Helya et al. describes a system for early detection of Alzheimer ' s disease (AD) and multi-stage classification with the help of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Two methods are explored: specifically, the use of 2D and 3D CNNs for structural images, and apply transfer learning with VGG19 to improve the classification performance. Therefore, based on the ADNI dataset, the highest precision rate established was 93.61% in 2D; 95.17% in 3D, and 97% in VGG19.

Because of the variations witnessed in the quality of images and the small differences in the brain boundaries some preprocessing techniques are very essential to improve the input images (24). First, a process of image normalization is conducted so that the pixel values range from 0 to 1 to reduce possible deviations due to image sizes. Although no explicit denoising or contrast enhancement was applied, several data augmentation techniques were used to enhance the training data and improve model robustness. These included random rotations, zooming, flipping, and brightness variation. All images were resized to 224 \u00d7 224 pixels and normalized to a pixel intensity range of [0, 1] before being fed into the models. This makes the model generalized better and also relieves it from overfitting (25). All these preprocessing steps serve to enhance the quality of data put into the ensemble model for the correct identification of Alzheimer's stages (26).\n- a.) Normalization: normalization is the task of adjusting the range of pixel intensities of an image to a standard range, often the interval [0:1]. The most common method is min-max normalization, which can be expressed mathematically as given in the Equation 1 below:\n$$x _ { n o r m } = x - x _ { \\min } \\frac { x - x _ { \\min } } { x - x _ { \\min } }$$\nwhere x$\\_{norm}$ is the normalized portion of the pixel value, x is the actual pixel value, and x$\\_{min}$ is the minimum value of the pixel in the picture, x$\\_{max}$ is the maximum value of the pixel in the picture.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/58", "#/texts/59", "#/texts/60", "#/texts/64"], "page_nos": [1], "uuid": "37c39149-154c-4120-b48b-e5be0b1f304a"}

To standardize input dimensions for model training, each 2D MRI slice was resized to 224 \u00d7 224 pixels using bilinear interpolation. This resizing adjusted the number of image pixels but did not account for physical voxel dimensions, which could not be preserved due to the absence of spatial resolution metadata in the JPEG-formatted dataset. So, the scaling factors for width and height are computed as in Equation 2 below:\n$$s _ { w } \\, = \\, \\frac { W _ { o u t } } { W _ { i n } } \\, , \\, s _ { h } \\, = \\, \\frac { H _ { o u t } } { H _ { i n } }$$\n- c.)

ResNet's principal invention is the residual block; this essential function is a \" shortcut \" or direct pathway that sends the input to the layer through to the output. This allows the model they base to skip certain layers and decrease the gradient disappearance problem in very deep networks (27). These shortcut connections help the network retain accuracies of deeper models possible without crossing the degradation issue by \" jumping \" other layers.

The second one is another convolution layer with size 3 \u00d7 3 to cover spatial connections and explicit features. The third layer is another 1 \u00d7 1 convolution to get back to the original dimensions of the feature maps. After each convolution there is normalization to make the training process faster and more stable, as well as using activation function (ReLU). The feature that is unique to the convolutional block is the projection shortcut connection, which uses 1 \u00d7 1 convolution to bring the dimensions of the input to match that of the processed features. This makes some sense as it actually establishes compatibility for the element-wise addition on the shortcut and the convoluted feature maps. Then a feedback layer addition is applied, and finally has the activation function to get the output. This design makes it possible for ResNet-50 to learn initially both low level and high-level features in deep networks.\nIn addition, an identity block in ResNet-50 as depicted in Figure 4c is an essential building block aimed at transferring features well through deep architectures. As it will be seen, the identity block retains the input dimensions since it uses a skip connection that feeds the input directly to the output without any change of dimension. This helps in making the model fast and stable while processing in the later stage of the training. The identity block contains three layers of convolution. The first is a 1 \u00d7 11 times one convolution layer that is aimed at the dimensionality of the input feature maps. This is succeeded by a 3 \u00d7 33 times three convolution which extracts spatial features and patterns, and one more 1 \u00d7 11 times one convolution which brings back dimensionality. Each convolutional layer is associated with batch normalization to update the activation for acceleration of convergence as well as activation function like ReLU.

EfficientNet-B3 is one particular network in the Efficient Net series of models and, as with all models in this series, this network enforces a balance between these three aspects to yield decent compromise between model complexity, model accuracy, and compute requirements (26). The scaling is governed by Equation 8:\n$$d = \\alpha ^ { \\phi }, w = \\beta ^ { \\phi }, r = \\gamma ^ { \\phi }$$\nwhere d , w , and r are the network's depth, width, and resolution, respectively and where \u03b1 , \u03b2 , and \u03b3 are parameters.

This fusion\nallows the ensemble to benefit from the complementary strengths of both networks: EfficientNet-B3 offers high efficiency with fewer parameters, while ResNet-50 contributes deep hierarchical feature extraction through residual learning. To stabilize training and reduce internal covariate shift, batch normalization is applied to the fused features, followed by a dense layer with 256 neurons and ReLU activation for non-linearity. Regularization techniques,\nPicture type: bar\\_chart\nincluding both L1 and L2 penalties, are applied to prevent overfitting, and a dropout layer is used to further improve generalization. The final classification is performed through a fully connected layer that maps the processed features to class probabilities. The model is trained using categorical cross-entropy loss, which evaluates the difference between predicted and true class labels. Overall, this ensemble design enhances diagnostic performance by combining the robustness of two diverse deep learning architectures as in the Figure 6 .

The classification method shows minimal mistakes because occasional Very Mild Demented cases accidentally overlapped with non-demented cases (19 images) while other classification results were unaffected (31). The integrated ResNet50 and EfficientNet-B3 model successfully identifies different dementia stages because of its powerful feature extraction strengths. Both ResNet50 and EfficientNet-B3 contribute remarkable capabilities to classification accuracy by demonstrating strong combinations of deep learning methodology and parameter optimization capabilities. The ensemble model proves highly suitable for early-stage Alzheimer ' s detection through its minimal misidentification errors in identifying groups of Moderate Demented patients along with Mild Demented patients as shown in Figure 12. The ensemble model demonstrates high diagnostic accuracy which makes it suitable for automated Alzheimer ' s disease detection systems that would help doctors intervene early and make better medical choices. The ensemble model demonstrates superior performance by attaining maximum accuracy while making the fewest classification errors especially in subjects with Mild and Moderate Demented diagnosis.

The combination of EfficientNet-B2 with VGG16 allowed researchers to produce a model that reached 97.35% accuracy through transfer learning applications. Individual use of ResNet50 in previous research reached an accuracy of 80.14% yet displayed spaces where its classification accuracy might be enhanced. Research results using multiple models including VGG16 and DenseNet121 with ResNet50 demonstrated an accuracy level of 84.67 percent which indicates the requirement for better ensemble strategies. The research introduces an ensemble model that joins ResNet50 with EfficientNet-B3 to improve classification outcomes in a major way. The proposed model delivers 99% overall performance accuracy because Mild Demented, Moderate Demented, and Non-Demented classes achieve precision, recall and F1-score values of 1.00. Feature extraction capabilities of EfficientNet-B3 reveal its superiority over ResNet50 since individual assessments show precision at 0.95 vs. 0.87 and an F1-score of 0.99. To surpass benchmarked models this research generated an ensemble method that brings together beneficial characteristics from EfficientNet-B3 and ResNet50 including their optimized architecture and deep feature learning ability. Its high classification accuracy makes this approach a promising option for automated Alzheimer's detection while enabling better medical decision support particularly during early diagnosis. A summary of these two methods appears in Table 7.\nSeveral recent studies have contributed valuable insights into the development of intelligent diagnostic systems, which support the objective of this research.

The proposed model extends clinical abilities of neurologists and radiologists through its accuracy enhancement and robustness while facilitating timely precise diagnostic procedures that minimize human error and enhance early treatment strategies. The absence of patientlevel demographic data, including age and gender, limits the model's ability to analyze performance variations across different population subgroups. Future work will utilize clinically annotated datasets to enhance interpretability and fairness and use datasets that allow patient-wise splitting to ensure proper generalization. The lack of patient identifiers prevented subject-level data splitting. Consequently, the model may have been exposed to highly correlated adjacent slices across training and test sets, increasing the risk of overfitting and overestimating performance. Although augmentation and splitting were carefully performed, the absence of subject identifiers may result in correlated slices from the same subject appearing in different data subsets, potentially impacting generalization. Through implementation in hospital imaging platforms the ensemble model functions as a medical decision tool which enables specialists to detect Alzheimer's disease manifestations at different stages confidently. Due to the absence of raw volumetric MRI files and acquisition metadata, advanced corrections such as N4 bias field correction could not be applied, which may affect intensity uniformity across slices. Since the dataset was pre-augmented and lacks original raw scans, it may not be suitable for standalone testing or external benchmarking. This restricts our ability to fully assess generalization and may introduce bias if augmentation artifacts influenced the model. Deep learning methods showcase their potential to outperform conventional diagnostic methods through the successful ensemble architecture which unites ResNet50 and EfficientNet-B3 networks. A key limitation of this work is the absence of imaging acquisition metadata, such as sequence types and scanner specifications, as the dataset was sourced from a publicly available platform (Kaggle) that did not include these details. This limits our ability to assess the model's robustness across different clinical imaging conditions. The enhanced accuracy of combined model identifications results in increased abilities to distinguish dementia's early stages from standard brain abnormalities thereby enabling prompt medical care. The improved diagnosis system reliability comes from better misclassification control which decreases false-positive and falsenegative outcomes leading to incorrect diagnosis. Medical imaging is undergoing significant change through artificial intelligence as studies demonstrate the practical benefits of automatic Alzheimer's disease detection on a wide scale basis.

The model utilized ResNet-50 to extract efficient features and EfficientNetB3 to classify robustly while remaining effective against challenges in medical imaging applications. Precise model training and evaluation became possible through the reliable annotations and diverse high-quality image dataset which contained 33,984 images. Preprocessing methods performed through normalization, rescaling, and noise removal improved the model quality for enhanced robustness. The model demonstrated superior performance as shown through precision and recall scores together with F1-score and area under the ROC curve metrics during comprehensive evaluations across all stages of Alzheimer's disease. Our model achieved consistent training and validation accuracy improvements which converged at 99.32% with minimal overfitting observed in loss plots thus, proving its strong generalization potential. Analysis of the confusion matrix demonstrated that the model produced accurate results for both Mild and Moderate cases along with non-denomented cases and achieved commendable accuracy when identifying Very Mild Demented cases. The research data shows that the ensemble model delivers strong diagnostic capabilities for Alzheimer's detection across severe disease manifestations. High-quality data alongside deep learning produces better diagnostic accuracy according to the research findings. Its performance quality makes the model suitable for clinical use because it provides essential medical decisions to doctors for early disease detection and ongoing care regulation.
