There are multiple reasons for this, including arbitrary age cut-offs, medical comorbidities as exclusion criteria, and the perception that older people may not have capacity to consent or that they will not wish to participate in research [\n1\n].\nAn alternative to actively recruiting participants for research is using routinely collected health data for health research. This helps to reduce selection bias by including older people, thus making the findings more generalizable to this group and allowing them to benefit from the generated research evidence. Some argue that not using routinely collected health data potentially causes harm due to the consequent lack of robust evidence for benefit or harm in people who are unable to participate in traditional research. This further perpetuates the impact of ageism, stigma and discrimination [\n2\n,\n3\n]. Using routinely collected health data may also be more inclusive for those with cognitive impairment who are often excluded from traditional research projects due to researchers' assumptions about capacity to consent [\n1\n].\nUsing routinely collected health data for research in older adults has many potential applications such as falls prevention [\n1\n], and the prevention and management of chronic diseases [\n4\n]. In the area of dementia, routinely collected health data could be used to help improve early diagnosis, identify biomarkers, prevent decline in brain health, and monitor progression of dementia [\n5\n,\n6\n,\n7\n].\nThe utilisation of administrative data is increasing rapidly due to the explosion of artificial intelligence (AI) and is likely to be a cost-effective approach research tool for epidemiology and dementia prevention studies. The development of AI in health care [\n8\n] and the future applications of this technology are anticipated to particularly benefit older people as they are the highest users of healthcare services [\n9\n].", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/56", "#/texts/57", "#/texts/58", "#/texts/59", "#/texts/60", "#/texts/61", "#/texts/62", "#/texts/63", "#/texts/64", "#/texts/65", "#/texts/66", "#/texts/67", "#/texts/68", "#/texts/69", "#/texts/70", "#/texts/71", "#/texts/72", "#/texts/73", "#/texts/74", "#/texts/75", "#/texts/76", "#/texts/77", "#/texts/78", "#/texts/79", "#/texts/80", "#/texts/81"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "9dadec4a-1eb4-4e99-9660-8b5f9a566882"}

Surveys exploring people's attitudes and perceptions regarding this issue [\n9\n,\n10\n] have shown that people are generally positive about the use of their data for research, but oppose the idea of their data being shared with private companies [\n11\n,\n12\n,\n13\n,\n14\n]. Qualitative research studies have used one-to-one interviews and focus groups to examine these issues in greater depth, exploring patients' attitudes towards the sharing of routinely collected health data. Several studies [\n2\n,\n15\n,\n16\n] reported that participants were generally positive towards data sharing due to its potential benefits for patients, the health community, and health services research. However, patients were concerned about confidentiality and potential misuse of their health data, for example, to discriminate or restrict their access to specific health services, and also potential discrimination by insurance companies.\nVery few studies have explored older people's attitudes and preferences around sharing their routinely collected health data for research purposes, especially in the context of brain health. One survey conducted in the United Kingdom reported that, of the whole population surveyed, people in the age group aged 75\u2009+\u2009were the most willing to share their health data [\n13\n]. Another survey of older adults attending senior centres in South Korea, showed that older adults were willing to share health data with families and hospitals but less willing to share with researchers and device developers [\n4\n]. An online survey of older outpatients in New Zealand specifically addressed the issues of cognitive decline and dementia and found that patients supported the use of their data provided that the population would benefit from its use [\n17\n].\nWhilst these survey results are important, the findings need to be investigated in more depth to understand the nuances, especially for the population at higher risk of dementia due to their age. To our knowledge there have been no qualitative research studies using one-to-one interviews or focus groups that specifically recruited older people to explore their attitudes about sharing their health data. The aim of this study was therefore to explore older people's attitudes and preferences about sharing their routinely collected health data for research purposes, especially in the context of brain health.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/82", "#/texts/83", "#/texts/84", "#/texts/85", "#/texts/86", "#/texts/87", "#/texts/88", "#/texts/89", "#/texts/90", "#/texts/91", "#/texts/92", "#/texts/93", "#/texts/94", "#/texts/95", "#/texts/96", "#/texts/97", "#/texts/98", "#/texts/99", "#/texts/100", "#/texts/101", "#/texts/102", "#/texts/103", "#/texts/104", "#/texts/105", "#/texts/106", "#/texts/107", "#/texts/108"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "5f9d67be-de24-4829-889e-5d98d2e8b6fa"}

The sample was ascertained from a subsample of service users who responded to a prior online survey which sought to gain an understanding of the attitudes of older people about the management of their health information [\n17\n]. The survey was distributed by email to people who met the following inclusion criteria: [\n1\n] currently resident in New Zealand [\n2\n] aged 55 years or older, and [\n3\n] currently using health services in Te Whatu Ora Counties Manukau.

The scenario was based on a previous more generic case scenario developed by one of the authors (RD) for a similar study in younger adults [\n2\n]. Our case scenario explored topics around the use of de-identified health data for health service improvement and health services research, but with a specific focus on brain health and dementia. The topics included sharing data with academic partners local and overseas, linkage with other health data (e.g., utilisation of healthcare resources, mortality data); allowing private companies to use the data in order to develop new medical equipment (possibly for profit); and using data from people who are unable to consent (such as those who have developed severe dementia or have died). Participants were encouraged to ask questions and discuss each step of the scenario so that they fully understood the issues.

Transcripts were analysed by two of the authors (BH and LG) using thematic analysis. The phases outlined by Braun and Clarke [\n19\n] were used for analysis. Thematic analysis was chosen as a method to analyse the data, as it enabled the investigators to understand the motivation for participants' attitudes towards sharing health data, and the meaning those attitudes had for them. The two team members familiarized themselves with the data, documented initial ideas and themes, and then started data coding across the whole dataset. The case scenario questions helped shape how data was collected, but the researchers didn't use those questions as a predetermined coding framework for their analysis. The initial codes were collated into potential themes and were cross-checked with coded extracts and the data set. The two researchers (BH and LG) had regular meetings where themes were reviewed, defined and named to produce the report. After the themes were identified, the researchers went back to the transcripts to find exemplars.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/125", "#/texts/126", "#/texts/127", "#/texts/128", "#/texts/129", "#/texts/131", "#/texts/132", "#/texts/133"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "18dfd1a2-538f-4f6d-a5e1-6791f5911846"}

The responses are rooted in local cultural expectations and are thus an important resource for New Zealanders who may prefer that research is carried out in their own communities rather than depending on the results of research carried out in other populations. The responses reflect those of New Zealanders of mostly European ancestry, so cannot necessarily be generalised to other ethnicities within New Zealand, nor to people living elsewhere. However the attitudes of older patients in New Zealand around sharing routinely collected health data were similar to attitudes expressed by people living in other countries [\n11\n,\n14\n,\n16\n], as well as younger New Zealanders, in that participants were mostly positive about the use of their data for research, but opposed the idea of their data being shared with private companies, and feared potential discrimination on the basis of their health data [\n2\n,\n15\n,\n16\n].\nIn our study there was strong support for multi-institution sharing of data to facilitate new discoveries. This finding may have been influenced by the New Zealand experience of the COVID-19 pandemic, where people were very aware of how collaboration led to the discovery of vaccines as well as new variants of the virus. However, the COVID-19 pandemic also made people more aware of how their health data were used by governments to help control disease [\n2\n,\n13\n] by controlling the behaviour of the population. Attitudes have changed towards this aspect of disease control and may therefore be the reason for some participants' concerns about the potential impact on society. Participants in our study were also strongly supportive of their data being used for educational purposes and for young researchers to thrive, however some previous qualitative studies have reported participants being opposed to sharing their health data merely to benefit individual researchers or help advance their careers [\n15\n]. This finding may be reflective of the life stage of our participants especially as some mentioned that their children or grandchildren were researchers or students.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/469", "#/texts/470", "#/texts/471", "#/texts/472", "#/texts/473", "#/texts/474", "#/texts/475", "#/texts/476", "#/texts/477", "#/texts/478", "#/texts/479", "#/texts/480", "#/texts/481", "#/texts/482", "#/texts/483", "#/texts/484", "#/texts/485", "#/texts/486", "#/texts/487", "#/texts/488"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "0d8b000f-17b3-4569-aee8-7fbf34b7aa05"}

Very few, if any, participants were aware that, alongside other consent procedures on admission to hospital, they also give consent for their data to be used in research and quality improvement projects to improve the health of the local population and local health services. Participants in other studies [\n15\n] recognized that the requirement of consent may lead to selection bias and low participation rates. The participants in our study may therefore simply need more information about the consent and research process. We have also identified a need to provide more information to patients about how their data might contribute to improvement of health services and population health outcomes, and to feedback to communities how their data has helped others.\nDespite the fact that the majority of our participants were of New Zealand European ethnicity, one of the prominent themes in our study was the consideration for other cultures, specifically M\u0101ori culture, and awareness of using data in a culturally respectful way. There was a comparable finding in a study of younger New Zealanders [\n2\n] where participants were concerned that if data were shared with international institutions, the overseas researchers may not have a sufficient understanding of M\u0101ori culture.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/489", "#/texts/490", "#/texts/491", "#/texts/492", "#/texts/493", "#/texts/494"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "eb34484a-ce19-4936-8f87-e46bffe4dec9"}

Participants were recruited by asking people who took part in an online survey about whether they would be willing to take part in a one-to-one online interview conducted in English. Recruiting therefore happened from a cohort of people who can be expected to have a relatively high digital literacy. Moreover, interviews were conducted over Zoom, which excluded participants who did not have the hardware, software, or internet connection to participate in such a study. Participants may have found the presented case scenario and accompanying questions challenging to understand, despite the interviewer encouraging opportunities for clarification and discussion. The fact that the majority understood the scenario may corroborate the suggestion that this is a high health literacy sample. The interviews were conducted in English which may have excluded many older non-Europeans who were not comfortable being interviewed in English. In other qualitative research conducted in the same geographic area we found that 80% of Pacific and Asian participants preferred to be interviewed in their native language [\n20\n]. Most M\u0101ori participants expressed a preference for face-to-face interviews (which are being arranged as part of a future project).

The case scenario was chosen to prompt older participants to discuss their thoughts on sharing routinely collected data. However, the case scenario may have overstated the potential benefits and underestimated the risks associated with data sharing; for example, the risk of re-identification was not specifically mentioned. The questions also did not differentiate between different types of data that participants may be willing to share (for example cognitive versus physical data) and did not capture the complexity of the debate surrounding the early detection and disclosure of dementia risk. These are all important issues as it is likely that, with over 50% of dementia currently unidentified [\n21\n], there is increasing enthusiasm to use routinely collected health data to \"case-find\" dementia. The ethical implications of using health data for dementia case-finding must be addressed [\n22\n]. The psychological harm of detecting dementia in a person who did not ask for the assessment might outweigh the benefit of identifying previously undiagnosed dementia [\n23\n]. People may not wish to know if they are at risk of a currently untreatable disease, but others may feel that earlier diagnosis gives a person time to plan for the future. These issues are complex, but the use of artificial intelligence with health data is accelerating fast, so it is important that patients and the public are involved in these discussions.\nOur participants reinforced the need for governance around data sharing. When routinely collected health data are shared with private companies, this should be done in an ethically responsible way. This becomes pertinent, both now and in future, with the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI could have many potential benefits, especially for the elderly who could benefit from improvements in healthcare. However, it should be developed for the welfare of society, and ethical principles such as transparency, beneficence and privacy should therefore be embedded in its development [\n8\n,\n24\n]. This highlights the urgent need for consensus guidelines and legal frameworks to protect health data but also enable its use in a way that can eventually benefit the health system, patients, and society in general.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/498", "#/texts/499", "#/texts/500", "#/texts/501", "#/texts/502", "#/texts/503", "#/texts/504", "#/texts/505", "#/texts/506", "#/texts/507", "#/texts/508", "#/texts/509"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "64a9f92c-01bd-4ba2-a451-dfe2cf9decd0"}

Older people in our study were supportive of sharing their health data for research purposes provided that the research would benefit others, now and in the future. They expressed a desire to be included and to continue contributing to society as they get older and also after they have died. However, they expressed concerns about the consequences of sharing data, and they had strong expectations on how the data should be used in an ethical and responsible manner. The research highlights the obligation of researchers to handle data in a culturally respectful way and to use it to benefit communities while avoiding potential harms.\n\nContribution and legacy: a qualitative study of older people's attitudes about sharing their routinely collected health data for research purposes in New Zealand\nData availability\nThe datasets generated and/or analysed during the current study are not publicly available due high risk of participants identification but are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/511", "#/texts/513"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "e0e6a225-ad19-49ce-a8c0-e5016763c67c"}
