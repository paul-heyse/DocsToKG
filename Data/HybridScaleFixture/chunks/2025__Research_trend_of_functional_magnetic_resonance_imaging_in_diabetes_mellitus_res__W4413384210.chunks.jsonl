Future investigations should concentrate on predicting and early diagnosing cognitive function in patients with diabetes mellitus using fMRI. The findings of this study provide a valuable reference for researchers and clinicians seeking to explore the neurological dimensions of diabetes mellitus and develop targeted therapeutic approaches.\n\nResearch trend of functional magnetic resonance imaging in diabetes mellitus research: a visualization and bibliometric analysis\n1 Introduction\nDiabetes mellitus is a global health concern affecting millions of individuals worldwide, with its prevalence steadily increasing (\n1\n). Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease associated with complications that significantly impact patients' quality of life and healthcare systems (\n2\n). Among these complications, neurological issues, particularly cognitive impairment and structural brain abnormalities (\n3\n,\n4\n), have gained considerable attention in recent years. Cognitive impairment mainly includes Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia. People with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have twice the risk of mild cognitive impairment and dementia as non-diabetics, with about 20% of those over 60 years of age at risk of progression to dementia (\n5\n). The diagnosis of diabetes mellitus-related cognitive dysfunction mainly relies on neuropsychological scales (\n6\n,\n7\n), which may result in misdiagnosis. Besides, diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is one of the most common chronic complications of diabetes mellitus, with a prevalence of 50% (\n8\n,\n9\n). The development of foot ulcers is a serious consequence of the progression of DPN, possibly leading to amputation and death (\n9\n). Therefore, early diagnosis and treatment are particularly important. The current gold standard method for diagnosing DPN is electromyography (EMG). Although many patients with DPN show evidence of neurologic deficits on EMG, they do not present with neuropathic symptoms. Due to its insidious onset, DPN often goes undiagnosed in its early stages (\n10\n).", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/270", "#/texts/271", "#/texts/273", "#/texts/274", "#/texts/275", "#/texts/276", "#/texts/277", "#/texts/278", "#/texts/279", "#/texts/280", "#/texts/281", "#/texts/282", "#/texts/283", "#/texts/284", "#/texts/285", "#/texts/286", "#/texts/287", "#/texts/288", "#/texts/289", "#/texts/290", "#/texts/291", "#/texts/292", "#/texts/293", "#/texts/294", "#/texts/295"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "cbb016ad-7b98-493c-9c1e-ea7f82393ec7"}

In the context of diabetes mellitus, fMRI has been employed to explore the neurological impacts of the disease, revealing critical insights into cognitive function, brain connectivity, and neurovascular changes (\n14\n,\n15\n). fMRI can clearly show the anatomical structure of brain tissue and neuropathological features (\n16\n), which is important for diagnosing and treating T2DM cognitive dysfunction. Research has shown that patients with T2DM cognitive dysfunction have abnormal structural changes on fMRI (\n17\n). Furthermore, fMRI has become a practical tool for DPN imaging because of its noninvasive, radiation-free characteristics and its ability to reflect in real time the local oxygen consumption of various regions of the CNS in response to external stimuli (\n10\n,\n18\n). Although some reviews have discussed the fMRI study of diabetes mellitus, no research has summarized the overview, hotspots, and trends of the application of fMRI in diabetes mellitus using visualization and analysis methods.\nBibliometrics is the cross-cutting science that quantitatively analyzes all knowledge carriers using mathematical and statistical methods. Its main measurement objects are the amount of literature, the number of authors, and vocabulary. The amount of literature is mainly the variety of publications and journals and where lies the majority of the literature. The number of authors mainly refers to the researcher's personal or group. Vocabulary is mainly the variety of literature markers used to classify most papers (\n19\n). Bibliometrics research methods have been applied in many research areas, in medicine and other fields. Currently, literature research is often used in clinical settings to summarize the research frontiers and trends of certain diseases and to provide directions for clinical disease research (\n20\n).\nTherefore, this study aimed to perform a bibliometric analysis of the application of fMRI in diabetes mellitus research. By systematically analyzing publication trends, research hotspots, and collaboration networks, this study sought to map the current state of research, identify key focus areas, and highlight emerging trends.

These indicators cover key aspects of publications, including annual publication counts, citation frequencies, average citation rates, journal names, journal impact factors, publication countries/regions, publishing institutions, and authors. Excel allows researchers to organize and analyze bibliometric data efficiently. During the visual analysis process, three powerful bibliometric analysis tools were used to analyze the academic data comprehensively. These tools are VOSviewer (version 1.6.20), CiteSpace (version 6.3.R1), and R 4.3.3.\n1\nVOSviewer is a versatile software tool that plays a crucial role in mapping institutional collaboration, author collaboration, co-authorship, citations, and co-citations (\n21\n). VOSviewer allowed the visualization and exploration of complex collaboration and relationship networks within the academic domain, gaining deeper insights into the interconnections among authors, institutions, and publications. VOSviewer was used for keyword co-occurrence analysis, and CiteSpace software was used for keyword burst detection to delve further into emerging trends and research hotspots within our study field. The study employed CiteSpace 6.1.R1 for keyword co-occurrence analysis, setting parameters for time slicing from January 1981 to November 2024 (the initial publications in this field appeared in 1981). The time slice was set to 1 year; node types: keywords. When the node type was keywords, the threshold (top N in each slice) was 5, and the pruning method was pathfinder + pruning merged networks. Based on the parameter settings of each node, visual analysis was conducted to generate a keyword timeline map for the field of \"task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging\" research. The size of the nodes represents the number of publications, the thickness of the lines represents the strength of the link, and the color of the nodes stands for different clusters or times. The H-index was employed to quantify the academic impact of individuals and journals, respectively. The H-index is a vital indicator for evaluating the academic contribution of researchers and could predict their future scientific achievements (\n22\n,\n23", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/323", "#/texts/324", "#/texts/325", "#/texts/326", "#/texts/327", "#/texts/328", "#/texts/329", "#/texts/330"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "3fd040ea-f467-4449-9b07-4ae393e803bb"}

Firstly, the \"risk,\" \"dysfunction,\" \"impairment,\" and \"dementia\" keywords suggest that the current literature mainly focuses on diabetes mellitus and the risk of cognitive impairment/dysfunction. Increasing studies suggest that T1DM and T2DM are associated with decreased performance in multiple domains of cognitive function and structural and fMRI abnormalities of the brain (\n27\n,\n32\n,\n33\n). Therefore, some researchers began to establish dementia risk prediction modeling with fMRI data to predict cognitive impairment/dysfunction and dementia. For example, Samoilova et al. used MRI data to create a computer neural network model for predicting the development of cognitive impairment in DM based on brain neuroimaging techniques (\n34\n). There are few studies on the prediction of cognitive function in patients with T2DM based on fMRI (\n35\n). Therefore, future research should present a new solution idea, which extracts the characteristics from fMRI and establishes a cognitive function prediction model among diabetes mellitus patients.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/511", "#/texts/512", "#/texts/513", "#/texts/514", "#/texts/515", "#/texts/516", "#/texts/517", "#/texts/518", "#/texts/519", "#/texts/520", "#/texts/521", "#/texts/522", "#/texts/523"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "a23f85fc-e4e3-42e2-9568-a55942a61499"}

Diabetes mellitus is associated with cognitive decline and altered brain structure (\n32\n). FC can be used to reflect brain function, diagnose neurodegenerative diseases, and provide insights into pathophysiologic mechanisms (\n36\n,\n37\n). Blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signaling in fMRI reveals hemodynamic changes associated with neural activity and has been used to detect FC alterations in patients with T2DM and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (\n38\n-\n40\n). Region-specific FC provides useful features for T2DM-MCI diagnosis. Hence, FC is a potential biomarker for assessing the degree of cognitive decline (\n41\n). In addition, the application of multiple resting-state fMRI (rs-MRI) indices can detect abnormal neural activities in different brain regions in patients with T2DM, and a decreased coupling trend between the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) can help understand the early changes before cognitive impairment appears. Compared with other fMRI techniques, rs-fMRI is widely used because it requires the least number of patients, acquires signals more easily, and is proficient in recognizing functional areas in many different groups, even those with low cooperation. Therefore, rs-fMRI may be useful for detecting central nervous system impairment caused by T2DM with DPN (\n14\n). Many studies explored the fMRI imaging of the brain in T2DM cognitive dysfunction (\n42\n-\n44\n). Research found that hippocampal atrophy can be used as an early imaging marker for structural changes in brain regions of patients with T2DM cognitive impairment (\n45\n).
