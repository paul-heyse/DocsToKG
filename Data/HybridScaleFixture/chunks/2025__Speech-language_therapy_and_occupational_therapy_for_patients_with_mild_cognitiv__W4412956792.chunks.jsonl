As the prevalence of dementia will increase due to demographic change, healthcare systems face growing challenges, including timely diagnosis, equitable access to care, and managing the rising demand for health services. Speech-language therapy (SLT) and occupational therapy (OT) can help maintain cognitive function and quality of life, particularly in the early stages of dementia or mild cognitive impairment (MCI).

The syndrome is characterised by a progressive decline in cognitive functions and daily living abilities, resulting in impairments in orientation, communication, and episodic memory. In addition to age, modifiable factors such as cardiovascular health, lifestyle behaviours, and psychosocial conditions increase the risk of developing dementia [\n1\n,\n3\n].\nAlzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, accounting for 60-80% of all cases, followed by vascular dementia (5-10%) and less common types such as dementia with Lewy bodies (5%) and frontotemporal dementia (3%) [\n4\n]. Clinically, dementia is staged into three phases (mild, moderate and severe), and is often preceded by mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a multifactorial condition characterised by measurable cognitive decline that does not interfere with independent daily functioning [\n5\n]. In Germany, an estimated 3.7 million people are affected by MCI [\n6\n]. As a major risk syndrome with a threefold increased likelihood of progressing to dementia [\n7\n], MCI represents a critical window for early detection and timely intervention to decelerate or prevent further cognitive decline [\n8\n].", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/51", "#/texts/53", "#/texts/54", "#/texts/56", "#/texts/57", "#/texts/58", "#/texts/59", "#/texts/60", "#/texts/61", "#/texts/62", "#/texts/63", "#/texts/64", "#/texts/65", "#/texts/66", "#/texts/67", "#/texts/68", "#/texts/69", "#/texts/70", "#/texts/71", "#/texts/72", "#/texts/73", "#/texts/74", "#/texts/75"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "756f8313-79f3-4b12-9fb2-4b73e0b5192a"}

Besides, allied health professionals (AHPs), including speech-language therapists (SLTs) and occupational therapists (OTs), provide essential non-pharmacological interventions to support cognitive function, daily living abilities, and quality of life [\n10\n,\n11\n]. These interventions target both cognitive and functional impairment and are delivered in individual or group-based formats. Collectively, they are referred to as cognitive interventions and may also be provided by neuropsychologists, nurses, or social workers [\n5\n]. However, SLTs and OTs are the main providers of reimbursable cognitive therapies in German outpatient care [\n12\n], delivering the majority of services across more than 20,000 therapy practices [\n13\n]. By contrast, only around 200 neuropsychologists currently work in an outpatient capacity [\n14\n].

CST is a group-based program focusing on memory, attention, and communication. CT targets specific cognitive functions through structured exercises, while rehabilitation typically involves environmental modifications and caregiver training [\n5\n]. In recent years, the role of SLTs in cognitive dementia care has received growing attention, as progressive language and communication impairments occur in all neurodegenerative dementia types [\n15\n,\n16\n] and are often under-recognised [\n15\n]. Symptoms such as word-finding difficulties or problems following complex conversations are among the earliest symptoms of MCI and early-stage AD [\n15\n,\n17\n]. While often overlooked in typical dementia subtypes [\n15\n], language impairments are the core diagnostic criterion in rarer forms such as primary progressive aphasia (PPA) [\n5\n]. Overall, communication impairments are considered one of the most significant unmet needs in people with dementia (PWD) [\n15\n]. SLT specifically addresses language as a cognitive function and supports communicative participation. SLT interventions may include cognitive training like word-retrieval exercises or naming therapy, and caregiver-based communication strategies [\n18\n]. These interventions are individually tailored in close consultation with patients, families, and interdisciplinary teams [\n19\n]. In addition, SLTs provide dysphagia therapy, which becomes relevant in up to 85% of individuals in later stages of dementia [\n20\n,\n21\n].\nOT typically addresses broader cognitive functioning and daily-life performance, as well as neuropsychiatric symptoms and care partner support in PWD/MCI [\n22\n]. Depression commonly occurs in association with MCI and dementia, and behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia are frequent across the disease continuum [\n5\n]. Various approaches are used, including CST, reminiscence therapy (e.g. biographical memory work), and neuropsychological memory training techniques such as spaced retrieval or errorless learning [\n23\n].", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/93", "#/texts/94", "#/texts/95", "#/texts/96", "#/texts/97", "#/texts/98", "#/texts/99", "#/texts/100", "#/texts/101", "#/texts/102", "#/texts/103", "#/texts/104", "#/texts/105", "#/texts/106", "#/texts/107", "#/texts/108", "#/texts/109", "#/texts/110", "#/texts/111", "#/texts/112", "#/texts/113", "#/texts/114", "#/texts/115", "#/texts/116", "#/texts/117", "#/texts/118", "#/texts/119", "#/texts/120", "#/texts/121", "#/texts/122", "#/texts/123", "#/texts/124", "#/texts/125", "#/texts/126"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "72688ff2-c195-496b-9ab2-949d72f3765c"}

Evidence from controlled trials suggests positive effects on cognition, communication and quality of life in people with mild to moderate dementia [\n18\n,\n26\n,\n27\n,\n28\n,\n29\n], and potential benefits for communicative participation and quality of life have also been reported in moderate to severe stages [\n18\n]. CST is among the most extensively studied approaches and is considered cost-effective compared to standard care [\n30\n]. SLT-based partner-communication training has been shown to reduce caregiver burden [\n31\n,\n32\n], which is a major factor contributing to the institutionalisation of PWD [\n10\n].\nDespite this growing body of evidence, little is known about the real-world implementation of SLT and OT in dementia care. Although current guidelines recommend cognitive interventions, particularly in early stages [\n5\n], few studies have investigated how SLT and OT are used in practice. Available studies are based on small and incomplete samples [\n33\n,\n34\n,\n35\n] and do not differentiate between treatment indications. As a result, it remains unclear whether the treatments were prescribed primarily to address dementia-related cognitive impairment or other comorbidities, such as dysphagia [\n33\n,\n34\n,\n35\n]. Given the increasing complexity of dementia care, it is essential to use all available resources effectively, particularly in order to prevent the transition from MCI to dementia and to slow disease progression where possible. Real-world care data offer an opportunity to address this evidence gap by providing insights into actual service use, prescription patterns, and influencing factors [\n36\n].\nThis study therefore aims to:\n1.

This criterion ensured the availability of complete claims data, independent of healthcare utilisation frequency. Analyses of patient characteristics and therapy utilisation were conducted in the subpopulation with a newly confirmed diagnosis of dementia or MCI. Only psychiatric diagnoses from Chapter V of the ICD-10-GM indicating clinically manifest dementia or MCI were considered: F00.-* (Dementia in AD), F01.-* (vascular dementia), F02.-* (dementia in other diseases classified elsewhere), F03 (unspecified dementia), and F06.7 (MCI). The code F02 refers to dementia as a consequence of other diseases classified elsewhere in the ICD-10-GM system, such as Parkinson's disease or Pick's disease.

According to the German Catalogue of Therapeutic Services, these services must be prescribed by physicians to be reimbursed by the health insurers related to different indication codes. These codes also indicate the medical reason for the treatment. However, these codes often cover a wide range of conditions and do not provide information about the exact underlying disease. For this reason, the study linked the ICD diagnosis data to the use of SLT and OT on an individual basis.\nThe first step of the analysis assessed the overall proportion of patients who received SLT or OT, regardless of the indication. The second step examined whether these patients were being specifically treated concerning their diagnosis of dementia/MCI. In the case of SLT, a distinction was made between therapy for cognitive communication impairments (indication code: SP5) and therapy for dysphagia (indication code: SC), as these are dementia-related interventions. As both indications can be prescribed for different neurological conditions, physicians have the option to voluntarily document up to four ICD codes relevant to treatment on the prescription. These were also checked to see if a dementia/MCI diagnosis was recorded (dementia-specification of the prescription). OT already has a dementia-specific code (PS5 until 12/2020, PS4 since 1/2021) that allowed billing for cognitive training or psycho-functional treatment [\n12\n]. In the following, we refer to OT prescriptions using this code as \"dementia- specific OT\". Different services may be ordered per prescription (e.g. 30 min of individual SLT or OT cognitive training). SLT prescriptions typically cover 10-20 therapy sessions, and OT prescription 10 sessions.

Previous research has primarily focused on PWD and relied on survey-based methods, often without indication-specific analyses. For example, W\u00fcbbeler et al. [\n34\n] examined the use of physiotherapy and OT by\nn\n=\u2009560 caregivers of PWD in dementia networks throughout Germany. The results showed a comparatively higher use of OT (15.5%), but did not differentiate by indication. Kohler et al. 2014 [\n35\n] reported utilisation rates more comparable to our findings: only 3.1% of study participants (\nn\n=\u2009203 PWD) received OT and 1.9% received SLT. A meta-analysis by Michalowsky et al. [\n33\n] (\nn\n=\u2009103,980) found an average of 6.9 therapy sessions per year for PWD living at home, compared with 10.2 sessions in residential care. In contrast, our study revealed substantially higher therapy volumes: a median of 60 sessions per patient for SLT and 34 for OT within two years of diagnosis. However, the data reported by Michalowsky et al. [\n33\n] are only partially comparable due to differences in the combination of therapy services, calculation methods and time periods analysed [\n33\n].\nIt should be noted that the study period also includes the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated lockdowns in Germany (March-May 2020 and November 2020-May 2021) [\n41\n].

This perspective is lacking in the cited studies. According to observational studies, the average disease duration from diagnosis to death is 4.3-5.1 years (IQR: 2.3-8.0) [\n43\n]. In clinical practice, continuous therapy over the entire course of the disease is rarely implemented, as the intensity of treatment is typically prioritised during phases of higher expected benefit [\n44\n]. For this reason, our study focused on the first two years following diagnosis. It should be noted, however, that the coding of a formal diagnosis does not necessarily reflect the actual onset of dementia. Dementia is often diagnosed at an advanced stage. According to a survey of\nn\n=\u2009276 PWD in Germany, the median time between first symptoms and formal diagnosis was 16 months [\n45\n]. With that in mind, the diagnosis of MCI represents a timely opportunity for early intervention and monitoring to achieve a delay in disease progression [\n46\n].\nIn our study, one in five patients who received cognitive interventions from an SLT and one in seven patients who received cognitive interventions from an OT had a diagnosis of MCI. This indicates that the treatment of individuals with MCI is already part of current clinical practice. However, this level of care provision should be further developed and standardised to ensure earlier and more consistent support for this patient group. The majority of people with MCI in our sample received SLT for communication impairments, and logistic regression confirmed a positive association between MCI and SLT utilisation. This is particularly notable, as language and communication disorders are strong predictors of the progression from MCI to dementia [\n17\n]. SLTs can therefore play a special role in dementia care, taking on important tasks such as monitoring and early detection [\n46\n].", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/289", "#/texts/290", "#/texts/291", "#/texts/292", "#/texts/293", "#/texts/294", "#/texts/295", "#/texts/296", "#/texts/297", "#/texts/298", "#/texts/299", "#/texts/300", "#/texts/301", "#/texts/302", "#/texts/303", "#/texts/304"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "09977fc9-816a-4178-a5d4-a0e873a5e8d8"}

This aligns with the well-established role of OT in dementia care, which is supported by reimbursement policies and its inclusion in both the German S3 guideline on dementia [\n5\n] and the national dementia strategy [\n47\n]. In contrast, SLT is mentioned less frequently and remains underrepresented in interdisciplinary research and care models [\n26\n]. Nonetheless, the international discourse increasingly recognises the relevance of SLT in dementia care [\n48\n]. Leading professional associations such as the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) [\n19\n] and the Royal College of Speech Therapists (RCSLT) [\n49\n] have published position papers outlining the profession's scope and responsibilities within interdisciplinary dementia care teams. According to ASHA\u00b4s annual survey, communication disorders in dementia now represent the second largest treatment group in the adult sector [\n50\n]. This level of visibility and professional recognition has yet to be established in the German context.\nOur findings also indicate that SLTs were only marginally involved in the treatment of dysphagia among PWD. Given that the German S3 guideline explicitly mandates SLT involvement in swallowing therapy [\n5\n], a higher utilisation rate would have been expected. One possible explanation is that dysphagia typically occurs in later stages of dementia and may not have been captured during the two-year follow-up period. Additionally, it is likely that the small number of patients with MCI who received dysphagia therapy were treated for comorbid conditions such as stroke or Parkinson's disease, rather than for dementia-related symptoms.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/305", "#/texts/306", "#/texts/307", "#/texts/308", "#/texts/309", "#/texts/310", "#/texts/311", "#/texts/312", "#/texts/313", "#/texts/314", "#/texts/315", "#/texts/316", "#/texts/317", "#/texts/318", "#/texts/319", "#/texts/320", "#/texts/321", "#/texts/322"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "1b411028-d170-48f6-b3de-9f10bcdcaaa5"}

Unlike OT, it is not possible to reliably determine from the available data whether SLT was prescribed for dementia/MCI or for other comorbid conditions. Since treatment-relevant diagnoses are not required on prescriptions, our findings may overestimate dementia-specific SLT use. This interpretation is further supported by the logistic regression results, which showed significantly higher odds of receiving SLT among patients with vascular dementia and dementia associated with other neurological diseases compared to those with AD. This suggests that SLT was often prescribed to address comorbidities rather than dementia symptoms. Its established use in conditions such as stroke and Parkinson's disease may explain the more frequent application in these dementia subtypes. In contrast, OT was less frequently prescribed for non-AD patients, possibly reflecting its stronger emphasis in clinical research and treatment guidelines for AD compared to other dementia types [\n22\n].", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/323", "#/texts/324", "#/texts/325"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "b3f8064b-0a59-4ed7-98a0-a21b6ed3f3c3"}

These factors can be systematised using Andersen's behavioural model of health services utilisation, which distinguishes between three core components: predisposing characteristics, enabling resources, and individual need. Predisposing factors include demographic and social characteristics [\n51\n]. Our findings point to disparities in predisposing characteristics: Men were significantly more likely to receive SLT. This is particularly noteworthy given that women are not only more frequently affected by dementia, but also assume the majority of informal caregiving responsibilities, providing up to 70% of care hours for PWD [\n1\n]. These findings may reflect sex-based differences in referral patterns or help-seeking behaviour. It is also plausible that women, as primary caregivers, are more actively involved in organising healthcare and therapy services-potentially leading to higher therapy uptake among male patients [\n52\n]. In addition, biological and cognitive factors may contribute to these disparities. Research suggests that women with early-stage AD or MCI tend to outperform men on verbal memory tasks, potentially delaying the recognition of language-related deficits and subsequent referral to SLT [\n53\n]. Similarly, older people were consistently less likely to receive SLT, even though communication and swallowing difficulties typically increase as dementia progresses. In contrast, our findings did not show a consistent age-related trend in OT use, although previous studies suggest that older age and a higher number of comorbidities are associated with increased OT utilisation [\n34\n].\nEnabling or impeding factors refer to individual and structural resources that influence access to care, including educational level, socioeconomic status and physical accessibility [\n51\n]. Among PWD, restricted mobility and the need for support from care partners are well-documented barriers to therapy use [\n10\n]. Notably, our results indicate that both SLT and OT were more frequently provided through home visits, suggesting that increased awareness of this care modality may help to overcome some of these structural barriers.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/326", "#/texts/327", "#/texts/328", "#/texts/329", "#/texts/330", "#/texts/331", "#/texts/332", "#/texts/333", "#/texts/334", "#/texts/335", "#/texts/336", "#/texts/337", "#/texts/338", "#/texts/339", "#/texts/340", "#/texts/341"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "35dc4be8-670c-4429-9e1c-b2d64678f98a"}

Among PWD/MCI, limited awareness of available services may restrict therapy utilisation [\n10\n]. Moreover, individual-level barriers such as low health literacy, entrenched health behaviours, and psychological factors, including comorbid affective disorders such as depression, can further compromise the perceived relevance and uptake of therapeutic services [\n54\n].\nFinally, Andersen's model also incorporates contextual factors, including those on the provider side [\n51\n]. In Germany, usually PWD/MCI firstly get in touch with general practitioners, as they typically make the initial diagnosis and coordinate referrals to AHP-led service [\n55\n]. Existing research [\n10\n,\n56\n,\n57\n] highlights several practical and attitudinal barriers that contribute to explain the restricted use of these interventions. One commonly assumed explanation is the perception of financial restrictions. While AHP services are generally subject to budgetary limits in Germany, dementia is classified as a special prescription need, which exempts these therapies from standard cost-effectiveness evaluations [\n58\n]. This suggests that formal structural restrictions may not represent the main barrier. Qualitative findings by Wangler et al. (2020) [\n56\n] comprising\nn\n=\u200941 general practitioners, display additional practice-level barriers, including time and resource constraints, as well as scepticism regarding the benefits of non-pharmacological therapies [\n56\n]. This form of therapeutic nihilism is also reflected in international surveys, with both medical professionals and AHPs expressing concerns about whether PWD can meaningfully engage in or benefit from cognitive interventions [\n10\n,\n57\n].

Targeted education is needed to address this gap, not only for prescribers but also for AHPs involved in dementia care [\n10\n,\n55\n]. Therapists themselves often report uncertainty, for instance, in setting realistic and measurable therapy goals for PWD/MCI [\n57\n]. This is particularly evident in the area of SLT [\n48\n]. In Germany, dementia-specific interventions are not a standard part of SLT training programmes, whereas OT education typically includes relevant competencies [\n59\n,\n60\n]. This indicates the need for improved education, training programmes and clear guidelines to support therapists in practice. In addition to training, strengthening collaboration between OTs, SLTs, and neuropsychologists within an interdisciplinary cognitive rehabilitation framework is essential. Clearer role delineation, joint diagnostic and therapeutic planning could support more effective teamwork and improve care [\n26\n].\nAnother barrier to therapy access is a general shortage of qualified professionals available to deliver SLT and OT services in Germany [\n61\n]. To address this, more resource-efficient formats should be considered. One promising approach is group therapy, which allows a single therapist to treat several patients simultaneously. Despite its potential, group-based cognitive interventions such as CST remain underutilised in practice. This finding highlights the need for further research into barriers to implementation and the development of strategies to increase uptake. Additional research is also needed to evaluate the optimal duration, intensity, and cost-effectiveness of cognitive interventions for PWD/MCI in real-world care settings. Given that our findings indicate a median of 34-60 sessions per patient over two years, this may serve as a feasible benchmark for routine care. Cognitive interventions that also aim to reduce carer burden - as well as communication or educational training in a group setting - offer further potential [\n62\n]. Finally, it is equally important to ensure that both health professionals and PWD/MCI have access to explicit and comprehensive information about available therapeutic services.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/374", "#/texts/375", "#/texts/376", "#/texts/377", "#/texts/378", "#/texts/379", "#/texts/380", "#/texts/381", "#/texts/382", "#/texts/383", "#/texts/384", "#/texts/385", "#/texts/386", "#/texts/387", "#/texts/388", "#/texts/389", "#/texts/390", "#/texts/391", "#/texts/392", "#/texts/393"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "0e662fff-d7b6-413b-a58e-02fdde524928"}

Although only a limited number of SHI funds are included in the InGef database, previous analyses of the external validity show a good correspondence between the data set and the German population [\n39\n]. The use of routine data reduces the risk of bias due to non-response, recall or selection bias. Moreover, secondary data allow the inclusion of multimorbid and institutionalised individuals, who are often excluded from primary surveys. These characteristics make routine data particularly valuable for dementia-related health services research [\n63\n].\nNevertheless, the findings must be interpreted with caution, as claims data are primarily collected for billing purposes. They reflect diagnostic and prescribing behaviour rather than actual disease prevalence or clinical needs and are subject to limitations regarding data quality and validity. This is particularly relevant in the context of diagnosing MCI, dementia, and its subtypes, as dementia diagnoses in claims data are not standardised and do not correspond to prospective clinical assessments. In outpatient care, misclassifications and the frequent use of unspecific diagnoses are common, as also reflected in our analysis. Furthermore, the diagnosis of MCI is used heterogeneously in clinical practice and may represent a wide range of underlying conditions [\n5\n].\nClinical parameters such as disease severity, functional status, or exact duration of diagnosis could not be assessed. Additionally, it was not possible to determine whether patients who received SLT or OT had previously undergone similar treatment prior to their dementia or MCI diagnosis. Therefore, the entire analysis must be interpreted in the context of possible confounding by other diseases. This applies in particular to affective disorders [\n5\n], which may confound therapy utilisation patterns by influencing diagnosis, patient engagement, or referral behaviour. For a more accurate analysis, co-morbidities should have been included.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/395", "#/texts/396", "#/texts/397", "#/texts/398", "#/texts/399", "#/texts/400", "#/texts/401", "#/texts/402", "#/texts/403", "#/texts/404", "#/texts/405"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "0f397212-19c7-49d9-a171-2be48b2cc43b"}

Due to structural limitations in the German billing system, it was not always possible to determine whether SLT was prescribed for dementia-related symptoms or for other neurological conditions. This ambiguity may have led to an overestimation of dementia-specific SLT use. Furthermore, the data solely captures treatments billed to the SHIs, not those services that were excluded from reimbursement. Prescriptions from self-pay patients could not be included. Patients with private health insurance were excluded from the dataset, which may limit generalisability of the findings to the entire population.\n\nSpeech-language therapy and occupational therapy for patients with mild cognitive impairment and dementia: a retrospective cohort study using German health claims data\nConclusion\nSLT and OT are valuable resources in non-pharmacological dementia care. This study is the first comprehensive analysis of SLT and OT utilisation among PWD/MCI in Germany using nationwide health claims data. Our findings show that these services remain underutilised in routine care. The low uptake of SLT and OT, particularly among people with MCI, suggests missed opportunities for early intervention. The disparities observed in utilisation according to sex, age, and dementia type may reflect barriers to access and referral. Further research is needed to explore these disparities and develop targeted strategies to improve care pathways and integrate SLT and OT more effectively into routine dementia care.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/406", "#/texts/408"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "963b9d96-b661-4040-8b9e-58acfd8969bf"}
