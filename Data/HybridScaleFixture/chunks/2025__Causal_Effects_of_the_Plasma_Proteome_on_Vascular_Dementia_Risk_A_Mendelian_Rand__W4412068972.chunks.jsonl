While various risk factors have been identified, the role of plasma proteins in VaD etiology remains poorly understood. This study employs Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate the causal relationship between plasma proteins and VaD risk, complemented by experimental validation. We conducted a two-sample MR analysis using summary statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on plasma proteins and VaD. Plasma protein data were derived from the deCODE Health study, encompassing 35,559 Icelandic participants and genetic associations for 4907 circulating proteins. VaD GWAS data were obtained from the FinnGen biobank, comprising 2717 VaD patients and 393,024 controls. Instrumental variables (IVs) were selected based on genome-wide significance thresholds (P\n-8\nfor plasma proteins, P\n-6\nfor VaD). The primary analysis used inverse variance weighting (IVW), supplemented by weighted median, MR-Egger, simple mode, and weighted mode methods.

This number is projected to rise to 132 million by 2050 (Collaborators\n2022\n). Vascular dementia (VaD) is the second most common type of dementia after Alzheimer's disease, accounting for approximately 30% of all dementia cases (Jia et al.\n2020\n). VaD often has an insidious onset, making it prone to misdiagnosis or being overlooked. Disease progression is associated with poor clinical outcomes, including accelerated cognitive decline, reduced quality of life, and increased mortality risk (Wolters and Ikram\n2019\n). Unfortunately, due to the complex and poorly understood pathogenesis of VaD, no effective drugs have been developed to slow its progression. Therefore, identifying potential mechanisms and therapeutic targets for VaD is of great importance.\nProteins play a central role in all biological processes, both in health and disease. The human plasma proteome consists of proteins that are secreted or shed into the circulation, where they either carry out their functions or mediate cross-tissue communication (Zhong et al.\n2021\n). These proteins are often dysregulated in disease and represent important therapeutic targets. Together with the accessibility of blood compared to other tissues, plasma proteins provide an attractive source for identifying molecular signatures of disease in large cohorts. Some studies have investigated the associations between plasma proteins and VaD (Shang et al.\n2018\n). However, most of these studies relied on low-throughput protein measurement techniques and had limited sample sizes. Moreover, due to the observational nature of these studies, confounding bias and reverse causation were unavoidable. In other words, the associated plasma proteins identified in these studies may serve as biomarkers but are not necessarily causal factors of VaD. Therefore, stronger evidence is needed to clarify the role of plasma proteins in VaD.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/59", "#/texts/60", "#/texts/61", "#/texts/62", "#/texts/63", "#/texts/64", "#/texts/65", "#/texts/66", "#/texts/67", "#/texts/68", "#/texts/69", "#/texts/70", "#/texts/71", "#/texts/72", "#/texts/73", "#/texts/74", "#/texts/75", "#/texts/76", "#/texts/77", "#/texts/78", "#/texts/79"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "029546a7-eaaa-4f5a-9496-3f88eed4f503"}

This random allocation reduces susceptibility to confounding bias and reverse causation, making MR a powerful tool for causal inference (Davies et al.\n2019\n). In this study, we applied the MR approach to assess the potential causal relationships between plasma proteins and the risk of VaD using publicly available genome-wide association study (GWAS) data.

VaD is used as the outcome to elucidate the causal relationship between plasma proteins and VaD.\nThe instrumental variables selected for MR analysis in this study must satisfy the following three core assumptions to ensure the validity of causal inference:\n(1)The instrumental variable SNPs must exhibit a robust and statistically significant association with the exposure (plasma proteins). The strength of the genetic instruments is evaluated using the F-statistic; an F-statistic exceeding 10 indicates a strong correlation between the instrumental variable and the exposure.(2)The instrumental variable SNPs must be independent of other confounding variables that influence VaD.(3)The instrumental variable SNPs must impact VaD exclusively through their effect on plasma proteins, without any alternative causal pathways.\nTo further validate the findings from the MR analysis, we employed an in vivo animal model. Specifically, a bilateral carotid artery ligation model was used to simulate vascular dementia conditions.

The mechanistic investigation through protein-protein interaction network analysis uncovered a highly interconnected functional module comprising FN1, APOE, H6PD, CXCL1, CSF3, HSPA1B, TPI1, and CXCL13. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis revealed this module's primary involvement in humoral immune regulation, non-canonical NF-\u03baB activation, stress-responsive MAPK cascades, and apoptotic cell clearance. These pathways have been extensively documented to contribute to the self-perpetuating cycle of blood-brain barrier dysfunction and neuroinflammation resulting from chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (Wang et al.\n2020\n; Lee et al.\n2022\n). In the animal model studies, quantitative analysis revealed significant differential expression patterns for MED4 and NRXN1 among the investigated targets (MED4, COPS7B, CSF3, NRXN1, and LRRTM4), providing experimental validation of their putative roles in VaD pathogenesis.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/194", "#/texts/195", "#/texts/196", "#/texts/197", "#/texts/198", "#/texts/199", "#/texts/200", "#/texts/201", "#/texts/202"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "f4cfb1d9-8813-4fa8-9376-db5703a00bf8"}

Extensive research has demonstrated that mutations in NRXN1 are implicated in various neuropsychiatric disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (Bourgeron\n2007\n), schizophrenia (Sebastian et al.\n2023\n), and dementia (Patel et al.\n2023\n). While NRXN1 expression demonstrates progressive downregulation during Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression (G\u00f3mez Ravetti et al.\n2010\n). It exhibits a unique compensatory upregulation in vascular dementia (VaD) pathogenesis. This dichotomy likely stems from distinct pathological mechanisms between these disorders: under chronic cerebral hypoperfusion, the glutamatergic synaptic networks with highest metabolic demands-particularly hippocampal CA1-dentate gyrus projections and orbitofrontal cortex-striatal connections-sustain primary ischemic damage (Alfaro-Ruiz et al.\n2024\n), thereby triggering NRXN1 upregulation. This adaptive response may confer neuroprotection through two mechanisms: first, by reducing oxidative stress in synaptic mitochondria and preventing degeneration of thalamocortical circuits (Bartoli et al.\n2020\n); second, by stabilizing presynaptic membranes to counteract neuronal damage caused by vascular hypoxia (Palermo et al.\n2025\n). This compensatory mechanism represents a unique neural adaptation to vascular injury that stands in marked contrast to the progressive synaptic protein depletion observed in AD. Protein-protein interaction analysis identified NRXN1 as exhibiting the highest connectivity with FN1 and H6PD. As a presynaptic membrane protein, NRXN1's extracellular domain binds to the extracellular matrix via fibronectin (FN1). FN1 serves dual roles as both a ligand for APOE-containing lipoprotein particles and a regulator of CSF3 receptor (CSF3R) membrane stability in microglia (Ito et al.\n2014", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/214", "#/texts/215", "#/texts/216", "#/texts/217", "#/texts/218", "#/texts/219", "#/texts/220", "#/texts/221", "#/texts/222", "#/texts/223", "#/texts/224", "#/texts/225", "#/texts/226", "#/texts/227", "#/texts/228", "#/texts/229", "#/texts/230", "#/texts/231"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "974739b9-7584-4933-9020-825ca84b1418"}

NRXN1 upregulation may transiently mitigate structural damage by coordinating synaptic adhesion remodeling (through FN1) with lipoprotein metabolism and granulocyte factor signaling.

This apparent discrepancy reflects biologically distinct temporal dynamics rather than contradiction. MR captures lifelong exposure effects, whereas the animal model reveals acute/subacute transcriptional responses post-ischemia (VanderWeele et al.\n2014\n). Under chronic cerebral hypoperfusion, ROS/Ca2\u207a overload activates non-canonical NF-\u03baB and stress-responsive MAPK pathways (Lee et al.\n2022\n), leading to massive recruitment of MED4-containing mediator complexes to sustain high transcription of inflammatory-metabolic genes (Garcia-Bonilla et al.\n2015\n). When transcriptional demand exceeds nuclear MED4 replenishment capacity, a \"compensatory depletion\" of MED4 occurs during the subacute phase, ultimately disrupting cellular energy metabolism and protein homeostasis. Notably, alternative transcriptional regulatory pathways can partially sustain gene expression even under conditions of Mediator complex insufficiency, suggesting the existence of compensatory transcriptomic reprogramming in VaD pathogenesis (Allen and Taatjes\n2015\n). The upregulation of NRXN1 likely represents a compensatory neuronal response to ischemic injury. Mechanistically, this process may involve p38-CaMKII signaling pathway activation, through which NRXN1 cooperates with FN1 and H6PD to establish a \"fibronectin-lipoprotein\" network. This integrated network serves dual neuroprotective functions during the acute phase by both strengthening synaptic adhesion and remodeling extracellular matrix architecture, thereby mitigating structural damage (LaConte et al.\n2016\n; Iijima et al.\n2011\n; Lukomska et al.\n2024\n; Loniewska et al.\n2020\n).However, this adaptive mechanism appears linked to excessive unfolded protein response (UPR) activation (Xiao et al.\n2013", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/235", "#/texts/236", "#/texts/237", "#/texts/238", "#/texts/239", "#/texts/240", "#/texts/241", "#/texts/242", "#/texts/243", "#/texts/244", "#/texts/245", "#/texts/246", "#/texts/247", "#/texts/248", "#/texts/249", "#/texts/250", "#/texts/251", "#/texts/252"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "2d7e5b4b-3978-4a95-bf72-404c340903e8"}

Furthermore, long-term NRXN1 overexpression (as demonstrated by MR analysis) may exacerbate dysfunction in the matrix-immune axis (Patel et al.\n2023\n). Collectively, the compensatory depletion of MED4 coupled with acute NRXN1 upregulation disrupts synaptic plasticity and metabolic homeostasis, driving characteristic spatial memory deficits in the rat model-revealing a critical transition from adaptive compensation to decompensation in vascular dementia pathogenesis.\nAlthough CSF3, COPS7B, and LRRTM4 did not exhibit statistically significant differences during the animal validation phase, their trends suggest that these genes may have potential biological significance in the pathological process of VaD. Therefore, it is necessary to further investigate the roles of these genes in larger human samples.

Recent studies have highlighted the significant impact of CSF3 on the pathological mechanisms and potential treatment of dementia. The reports indicate that in mouse models of AD, CSF3 enhances spatial learning abilities and significantly reduces amyloid deposition in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex (Sanchez-Ramos et al.\n2012\n). Research suggests that CSF3 may improve non-spatial cognitive functions in patients with cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) by restoring brain vascular endothelial cell function, repairing blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage, and reducing white matter lesions (Tuo et al.\n2019\n; Wei et al.\n2017\n). In this study, although the expression of CSF3 in the model group was higher than in the sham-operated group, the difference did not reach statistical significance. However, from a numerical perspective, this change still holds potential biological significance. This discrepancy may reflect the diverse roles of CSF3 in different pathological contexts. Studies have shown that cytokine levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) exhibit age-related changes in Alzheimer's disease patients, such as increased levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-8 with advancing age (Hu et al.\n2019\n). Furthermore, the patterns of change in CSF A\u03b242 and sTREM2 levels vary across different neurodegenerative diseases, suggesting that these biomarkers are associated with specific pathological mechanisms (Su\u00e1rez-Calvet et al.\n2016\n; Spitzer et al.\n2018\n).\nLRRTM4 exhibits highly selective expression in the brain, particularly at the excitatory postsynaptic sites of granule cells in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (Linhoff et al.\n2009\n). Loss of LRRTM4 function leads to reduced synaptic density, impaired AMPA receptor trafficking, and compromised synaptic function (Siddiqui et al.\n2013\n).", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/259", "#/texts/260", "#/texts/261", "#/texts/262", "#/texts/263", "#/texts/264", "#/texts/265", "#/texts/266", "#/texts/267", "#/texts/268", "#/texts/269", "#/texts/270", "#/texts/271", "#/texts/272", "#/texts/273", "#/texts/274", "#/texts/275", "#/texts/276", "#/texts/277", "#/texts/278"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "7950da11-80e2-410b-8a11-3b2c3ea55f80"}

Given its crucial role in maintaining synaptic plasticity and cognitive function, dysregulated LRRTM4 expression in vascular dementia (VaD) likely contributes to disease pathogenesis by disrupting synaptic integrity. However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying this process require further elucidation. Although COPS7B and MAGEA3 are more commonly studied in the context of cancer (Gaspar et al.\n2017\n; Gao et al.\n2020\n), their functions suggest they may also be relevant to VaD pathology. COPS7B is involved in regulating protein stability, while MAGEA3 influences cell proliferation (Tang et al.\n2023\n; Gaspar et al.\n2017\n). These roles indicate that both proteins could contribute to the pathological processes underlying VaD, warranting further investigation into their specific contributions.\nOverall, This study combines MR and animal experiments to reveal the significant role of plasma proteins in the pathogenesis of VaD. Through MR analysis, we can identify potential drug targets, offering new perspectives for VaD treatment strategies.
