This study compares the effects of cognitive reserve and the predicted brain age difference (PAD) on the risk of being diagnosed with ALS, the risk of having cognitive or behavioral impairment, or even fronto-temporal dementia, and on disease duration.\nOur results indicated that neither PAD nor cognitive reserve was associated with an increased risk of ALS, but that higher PAD was associated with an increased risk of cognitive impairments and FTD, as well as a shortened disease duration. Higher cognitive reserve on the other hand was associated with a lower risk of cognitive impairment and a longer disease duration.\nBrain age as a proxy of brain reserve influences disease progression and presentation more strongly than cognitive reserve.\n\nThe role of cognitive and brain reserve in the clinical presentation and progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis\nAbstract\nCognitive reserve is associated with education, social determinants, and cognitive outcomes among older American Indians in the Strong Heart Study\nArticle\nOpen access\n28 January 2025\n\nThe role of cognitive and brain reserve in the clinical presentation and progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis\nAbstract\nDeep learning-based brain age prediction in normal aging and dementia\nArticle\n09 May 2022\n\nThe role of cognitive and brain reserve in the clinical presentation and progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis\nAbstract\nNeuropsychological impairment in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-frontotemporal spectrum disorder\nArticle\n12 October 2023", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/47", "#/texts/49", "#/texts/50", "#/texts/51", "#/texts/54", "#/texts/55", "#/texts/56", "#/texts/58", "#/texts/59", "#/texts/61", "#/texts/62"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "b47756c8-4889-4fc3-a54f-8352ee1599f1"}

Concerning Alzheimer's disease (AD), high CR is associated with a relative risk reduction between 47-68%, depending on how CR is measured. Furthermore, evidence is mounting that bilingualism as a proxy of CR may delay symptom onset by several years\n2\n.\nThe concept of CR has recently been carried over from AD to diseases of the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and fronto-temporal dementia spectrum (ALS-FTDSD)\n3\n,\n4\n,\n5\n,\n6\n,\n7\n. Work including structural and functional brain imaging techniques showed that persons with higher levels of education and premorbid cognitive ability were able to retain better cognitive functioning after the onset of ALS\n3\n,\n4\n,\n5\n.

Conversely, accelerated brain ageing was associated with FTD. The driving force behind the resilience against cognitive impairment appeared to be higher cerebellar volume. These findings are consistent with the brain reserve (BR) hypothesis: individual differences in people's brains facilitate better coping with neurodegenerative diseases\n1\n. Such differences include brain volume (i.e., size) and synaptic density but also life experiences which influence brain anatomy via neurogenesis, angiogenesis, apoptosis and neural plasticity. BR is conceived as a passive model of reserve in the sense that a fixed amount of volume and synaptic density is assumed, alongside a threshold of maximum damage any given individual brain can cope with. In this model, BR is considered depleted once the threshold of maximum damaged has been crossed, and the clinical and/or functional deficits occur. The concept of brain age provides a proxy of BR, i.e. the difference between brain age estimated from MRI scans and chronological age (predicted age difference, PAD). PAD does not have an empirically established threshold of maximum damage, but our previous work suggests that a difference of six years is an appropriate threshold for cognitive impairment in ALS (ALSci)\n8\n. Notably, as cognitive impairment in ALS-FTDSD is considered a spectrum, not a continuum, it is not expected that all patients with ALSci will inevitably progress to ALS-FTD.\nThis present work will bring together the CR and BR hypotheses to investigate whether their protective effects, which long have been established in AD, do exist in the ALS-FTD spectrum diseases, too. This is distinct from our prior work which either excluded CR\n8\nor excluded BR from its designs\n3\n,\n4\n.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/90", "#/texts/91", "#/texts/92", "#/texts/93", "#/texts/94", "#/texts/95", "#/texts/96", "#/texts/97", "#/texts/98", "#/texts/99", "#/texts/100", "#/texts/101", "#/texts/102", "#/texts/103"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "33f20531-5b6d-45ce-b60f-e37f418ce36c"}

The present study combines four potentially protective characteristics to form a measure of cognitive reserve: educational years, occupational level, presumed premorbid intelligence and PAD (analogue to Consonni et al.'s work,\n7\n). Using these, we addressed four research questions. Firstly, we will examine the probability of developing an ALS-FTD spectrum disease based on these potentially protective characteristics.

In ALS, performance on this specific test has been shown to remain intact and indistinguishable from healthy controls\n15\n, and independent from physical disability. We assigned points for each educational year, and according to the international standard classification of education (ISCED) to reflect educational length and achievement. Crucially, the former - educational years - assigns points purely based on the length of time spent in formal education while the latter - ISCED levels - reflects educational achievement. For example, it is possible to obtain 13 years of education by primary and secondary education (\"Realschule\") followed by 3 years of vocational training (\"Berufsausbildung\"), resulting in ISCED level 4, or instead of \"Realschule\" by completing secondary education (\"Gymnasium\") without any further tertiary education or vocational training -resulting in ISCED level 3.

Onset type did not significantly predict outcomes, as the 95% credible intervals for its effects encompassed zero (ALSbi: b\u2009=\u2009-0.59, 95% CI: -2.29 to 1.06; ALSci: b\u2009=\u2009-0.47, 95% CI: -1.95 to 1.01; ALS-FTD: b\u2009=\u2009-2.32, 95% CI: -5.22 to 0.04). When onset type was included, only the effects of PAD remained robust, showing significant associations in ALSci (b\u2009=\u20091.20, 95% CI: 0.41 to 2.09) and ALS-FTD (b\u2009=\u20091.60, 95% CI: 0.42 to 2.88), while the effect of CR was no longer significant.\nResearch question 3:\nHow do Strong profile, PAD and CR affect total disease duration?", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/209", "#/texts/210", "#/texts/211", "#/texts/212", "#/texts/213", "#/texts/214", "#/texts/215", "#/texts/216", "#/texts/217", "#/texts/218", "#/texts/219", "#/texts/220", "#/texts/221", "#/texts/222", "#/texts/223", "#/texts/224", "#/texts/225", "#/texts/226", "#/texts/227"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "b1a3463d-4c43-415a-93ea-8cd7fa890f08"}

Among all patients, those with higher CR lived longer: each 1-point increase in CR was associated with 0.67 additional months of lifetime (approximately 20 days, see the OR in Table\n2\n). Conversely, being diagnosed with ALS-FTD decreased patients' lifetime by two months (b\u2009=\u2009-2.01, Table\n2\n). A detrimental effect was also observed for chronological age at time of assessment, for each additional year of age at diagnosis, participants lived approximately 17 days shorter (b\u2009=\u2009-0.55). There were no effects of PAD, sex, ALSbi or ALSci on total disease duration (see Fig.\n1\nC). We re-ran this analysis excluding CR as a predictor to be able to better compare it to our previous work which relied on a simple Kendall's tau correlation\n8\n. This linear regression supported a negative effect of PAD on disease duration (b\u2009=\u2009-1.09, 95%CI -2.03 to -0.20). This intriguing observation prompted us to explore the association between PAD and CR in their effects on disease duration more thoroughly. As reported above, their VIF were well below 5 (VIF\nCR\n=\u20091.00, VIF\nPAD\n=\u20091.02), indicating that multicollinearity between them was low. We re-ran the linear regression with PAD and CR as predictors and added their interaction term. However, the interaction term yielded no meaningful effect (b\u2009=\u2009-0.20, 95% CI: -1.70 to 2.05), suggesting that CR does not systematically alter the influence of PAD on disease duration.

The aim was to compare the effects of cognitive reserve as well as PAD, the latter as a proxy of brain reserve. Neither measure mediated the risk of being diagnosed with ALS altogether. However, with each additional year that their brain was estimated to be older than their chronological age, patients' risk of being diagnosed with ALSci increased by 25%, and the risk of being diagnosed as ALS-FTD increased by 36%. Conversely, with each point in CR, their risk of being diagnosed as ALSci decreased by 20%. Similar protective effects by CR were observed on total disease duration: for each point in CR, patients' lifespan was extended by 20 days. This effect size sounds trivial but when we consider that the range of CR in our sample was 31-56 points, the possible life span extension associated with CR ranged between 620 to 1120 days (20 to 37 months). Most notably, this lifestyle effect exceeds the effect of Riluzole treatment, for which randomised clinical trials suggested a lifespan extension of approximately three months, and whose real-world evidence suggests an extension of up to 19 months' median time\n19\n. This highlights that CR supports patients' ability to cope with the increasing load of ALS-related neuropathology as the disease progresses. Conversely, being diagnosed with ALS-FTD reduced patients' disease duration by two months, i.e., these persons died two months sooner.

However, this previous finding was based on Kendall's tau correlations, which did not feature confounding variables. The present analysis is a regression analysis which considered CR, sex and age in addition to PAD as predictors of disease duration. This prompts the discussion of why PAD is associated with an increased risk of ALS-FTD - which in turn reduces disease duration - without affecting disease duration directly. PAD only constitutes a crude indicator of brain health while ALS-FTD as a disease affects the brain as well as the spinal cord, and in turn, body regions beyond, which perhaps better reflects the disease in total. One possible explanation for this discrepancy is that PAD is strongly driven by cerebellar volume\n8\n, which is not a primary determinant of disease duration in ALS. While cerebellar atrophy has been linked to neurodegeneration and motor dysfunction, ALS progression is characterized by widespread involvement of both upper and lower motor neurons, as well as cognitive decline in ALS-FTD. Thus, PAD may capture neuroanatomical changes that increase susceptibility to ALS-FTD but do not directly regulate the speed of disease progression.\nWhile work on CR and PAD and how they might affect disease outcomes in ALS is just at its beginning, this is well established in other neurodegenerative diseases, mainly in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The concept of CR refers to the capacity to retain adequate cognitive functioning in the presence of neurodegenerative changes, while of brain aging refers to the preservation overall age-related brain atrophy. In AD, PAD was found to be associated with cognitive decline\n22\nand molecular markers of pathology\n23\n. High CR may mitigate the accumulation rate of amyloid prior to cognitive impairment and support glucose metabolism during the dementia stage throughout the progression of AD pathology\n24\n.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/265", "#/texts/266", "#/texts/267", "#/texts/268", "#/texts/269", "#/texts/270", "#/texts/271", "#/texts/272", "#/texts/273", "#/texts/274"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "cfbab789-a375-4715-b5fa-e30de2b16328"}

Given that our analyses showed no effect of CR on disease progression speed, we do not think that ALS' relatively aggressive progression is the reason for the absence of CR's effect here. Rather, we hypothesise that the neuropathology underlying ALS predominantly accumulates outside of areas where CR typically exerts its protective influence, e.g. the motor cortex. It is also possible that CR influences early, pre-symptomatic stages of ALS that were not captured in this study. With our data also rejecting PAD as a protective factor, there is now evidence supporting the theory that CR and brain reserve affect patients' ability to cope with neurodegenerative diseases distinctively. CR and PAD both mediating the probability of cognitive impairment, with PAD also playing a role in ALS-FTD is consistent with our prior work which showed that increased brain age was associated with fronto-temporal atrophy\n8\n, and that CR protects ALS patients from functional decline even when atrophy is present and increasing\n3\n,\n4\n,\n5\n. Additionally, since a lower PAD is partly driven by cerebellar volume\n8\n, this further distinguishes its effects from CR, which is more strongly associated with cortical and functional resilience. This difference may explain why PAD contributes to ALS-FTD risk but does not significantly influence disease duration once CR is included in the model.\nA recent study investigated the interplay of CR and brain age and found that higher CR was associated with lower cognitive impairment independent of brain aging\n27\n, while lifestyle trajectories were associated with brain aging but independent of cognition\n28\n. This aligns closely with our findings that CR and PAD might predict different aspects of ALS disease outcome.

Furthermore, there are some proxies of CR that were not available to us, such as level of regular exercise and multilingualism\n7\n. Furthermore, the brain-age analysis pipeline yields a single value and its ease of use might make it well suited in routine clinical care. However, it is conceptualized on the whole brain and distinct neuroanatomical information are not available. Consequently, it might not be sensitive enough for every disease entity depending on the spatial patterns of brain atrophy.\nAll in all, our findings provide some support for both, the cognitive reserve hypothesis and the brain reserve hypothesis. Given the effect sizes estimated here, it appears that CR had only moderately beneficial effects: namely, on the risk of developing cognitive impairment and longer disease duration. Contrastingly, the effect of accelerated brain ageing was more strongly detrimental, in the form of an increased risk of developing ALS-FTD. The finding that ALS-FTD is associated with a shorter disease duration independently from brain ageing speed supports the notion that not all factors underlying rapid disease progression are yet captured by brain age algorithms.\nIn conclusion, the present data indicate that the effect of low brain reserve is more detrimental than the positive effect of high cognitive reserve.
