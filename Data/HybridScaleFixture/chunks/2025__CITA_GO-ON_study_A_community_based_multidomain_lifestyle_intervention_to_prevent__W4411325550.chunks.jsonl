A community based multidomain lifestyle intervention to prevent cognitive decline. Protocol design and recruitment process\nIntroduction:\nGrowing research suggests that dementia is a complex disorder with multiple risk factors and causes. The Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability (FINGER) demonstrated that lifestyle interventions could confer cognitive benefits. Inspired by this, the GOIZ-ZAINDU (GZ) feasibility study adapted the FINGER approach to the Basque context. Building upon the GZ study, the CITA GO-ON trial aims to enhance and expand the evidence supporting dementia prevention through a multidomain intervention of risk factor management and resilience promotion.\nMethods:\nIt is a two-year, population-based, randomized controlled trial to prevent cognitive decline in adults aged 60-85 years with Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging and Dementia (CAIDE) risk score \u22656, no dementia, and below-than-expected performance on at least one of three cognitive screening tests. Participants are randomized (1:1) to receive either Regular Health Advice (RHA) or a Multidomain Intervention (MD-Int) that encompasses cognitive training, socio-emotional skills, multicomponent physical exercise, nutritional and culinary intervention, and monitoring for cardiovascular risks, pharmacological drug mismanagement, and comorbidities. The primary outcome is the efficacy of the intervention to reduce the risk of cognitive decline measured by the global composite\nz\n-score of the modified Neuropsychological Test Battery over two years. The secondary outcomes measure cost-effectiveness, quality of life, and functional abilities. Blood samples and brain imaging will also be collected to evaluate the effects of the intervention on brain structure and plasma biomarkers.\nResults:\nRecruitment has been completed with 1051 participants selected (mean age (standard deviation, SD) of 69.65 (6.36), 58,50 % female, and mean CAIDE (SD) of 7.62 (1.427). The final participant is expected to complete the last study visit by the autumn of 2026.\nDiscussion:\nThe CITA GO-ON Study, as a part of the World-Wide FINGERS network, is designed to validate the efficacy of a multidomain lifestyle intervention for dementia prevention and contribute valuable data to inform public health strategies fostering healthy, active aging.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/241", "#/texts/242", "#/texts/243", "#/texts/244", "#/texts/245", "#/texts/246", "#/texts/247", "#/texts/248", "#/texts/249", "#/texts/250"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "e56c4a49-4bf6-44ab-abec-ccde3d2ac25c"}

A community based multidomain lifestyle intervention to prevent cognitive decline. Protocol design and recruitment process\n1 Background\nDementia and late-life cognitive impairment impose significant disability and degradation of the quality of life for both affected individuals and their caregivers, leading to elevated social and healthcare expenditures. The global number of persons with dementia has doubled in recent years (\nGBD 2016 Dementia Collaborators, 2019\n), and forecasting models project a marked escalation in dementia cases if effective preventive measures are not established (\nSoto-Gordoa et al., 2015\n).\nInvestigations into dementia and neurodegenerative conditions have uncovered a multitude of underlying coexisting comorbidities, particularly in older populations (\nLarson et al., 2013\n;\nWu et al., 2017\n). In addition, a spectrum of lifestyle factors has been identified as influential in the risk trajectory for cognitive decline throughout life (\nNorton et al., 2014\n). Observational studies have reinforced that addressing traditional cardiovascular risk elements, such as hypertension, obesity, and diabetes, may delay the onset of cognitive deficits (\nKemppainen et al., 2018\n;\nO'Brien et al., 2019\n;\nDhana et al., 2020\n). A cognitively and physically active lifestyle is associated with healthy cerebral aging. Recent insights also revealed that deficits in social engagement and emotional well-being may contribute to the emergence of cognitive impairment (\nFratiglioni et al., 2020\n;\nLisko et al., 2021\n;\nR\u00f6hr et al., 2023\n). The multifactorial nature of cognitive decline suggests that interventions targeting a combination of lifestyle and health factors might offer superior preventive capability (\nSolomon et al., 2013\n;\nKivipelto, 2016\n). While some pharmacological trials have shed light on the treatment of Alzheimer's dementia (\nMintun et al., 2021\n;\nvan Dyck et al., 2022\n), a significant number have not successfully demonstrated efficacy in delaying cognitive decline (\nKivipelto et al., 2018a\n), highlighting the need for complementary nonpharmacological strategies for both primary and secondary prevention. The Lancet Commission on Dementia Prevention, Intervention, and Care underscores the importance of initiatives that promote lifestyle alterations and mitigate dementia risk factors in midlife and beyond (\nLivingston et al., 2020\n).", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/252", "#/texts/253", "#/texts/254", "#/texts/255", "#/texts/256", "#/texts/257", "#/texts/258", "#/texts/259", "#/texts/260", "#/texts/261", "#/texts/262", "#/texts/263", "#/texts/264", "#/texts/265", "#/texts/266", "#/texts/267", "#/texts/268", "#/texts/269", "#/texts/270", "#/texts/271", "#/texts/272", "#/texts/273", "#/texts/274", "#/texts/275", "#/texts/276", "#/texts/277", "#/texts/278", "#/texts/279", "#/texts/280", "#/texts/281", "#/texts/282", "#/texts/283", "#/texts/284", "#/texts/285", "#/texts/286", "#/texts/287"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "d3e91df1-c299-4c93-9a72-9d0bbda8fcbc"}

The Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability (FINGER) trial (\nNgandu et al., 2015\n) is a large-scale investigation that substantiates the cognitive benefits of a multidomain lifestyle intervention for older adults at elevated risk of dementia, as determined by the CAIDE dementia risk score (\nNgandu et al., 2014\n). Other similar multidomain interventions, such as the Multidomain Alzheimer Preventive Trial (MAPT) (\nAndrieu et al., 2017\n) and Prevention of Dementia by Intensive Vascular Care (\nvan Charante et al., 2016\n) (preDIVA) studies, yielded positive outcomes within participant subgroups characterized by higher CAIDE risk scores or those with cerebral amyloid deposition.

A community based multidomain lifestyle intervention to prevent cognitive decline. Protocol design and recruitment process\n1 Background\nIn the spirit of the pioneering FINGER study, the CITA-alzheimer research team group applied the CAIDE dementia risk score in non-demented longitudinal cohorts and population-based investigations (\nEcay-Torres et al., 2018\n). Our findings revealed that diminished cognitive performance was correlated with CAIDE risk score, vascular, amyloid, and neurodegenerative biomarkers in asymptomatic at-risk adults. Recently, our team embarked on a feasibility study called the GOIZ ZAINDU (GZ) trial (\nTainta et al., 2024a\n), which adapted the FINGER multidomain lifestyle intervention model to the cultural, healthcare, and social frameworks of the Basque region. Adherence to the intervention program and integration with existing health system protocols were pivotal in attaining the primary objective. Efficacy analysis revealed a significant less decline in executive function and processing speed in the multidomain intervention (MD-Int) group. These pilot findings laid the groundwork for a comprehensive efficacy trial, the \"CITA GO-ON\" study, registered with\nClinicalTrials.gov\n(NCT04840030). This trial encompasses older adults approaching cognitive decline, characterized by an augmented dementia risk as assessed by the CAIDE score manifesting either suboptimal performance in brief cognitive evaluations or persistent memory complaints (\nFigure 1\n).\nFigure 1\nFigure 1\n. CITA GO-ON study target population.\nThe primary objective of the CITA GO-ON study is to evaluate the efficacy of a multidomain lifestyle intervention as a preventive strategy against cognitive decline. Concurrently, this study will establish a repository of brain imaging and biomarker data, facilitating exploratory research on the physiological impacts of lifestyle modifications in the adult population. This paper delineates the principal protocol of the CITA GO-ON study, outlines the methodology used for participant recruitment, and provides an update on the current status of the study plan.\nThe success of the FINGER trial may be attributed to the meticulous selection of participants.\nThis encompasses an evaluation of the intervention cost-effectiveness and its potential integration into public health frameworks aimed to promote healthy and active aging, as well as dementia prevention.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/301", "#/texts/302", "#/texts/303", "#/texts/304", "#/texts/305", "#/texts/306", "#/texts/307", "#/texts/308", "#/texts/309", "#/texts/310", "#/texts/311", "#/texts/312", "#/texts/313", "#/texts/314", "#/texts/315"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "eb401ab0-8059-45cb-9cd4-6c08a2bb5ce1"}

These results are expected to be attained at an acceptable cost-effectiveness to ensure the public health utility of the intervention in promoting healthy aging and dementia prevention.\nThe central hypothesis of the CITA GO-ON study postulates that a multidomain lifestyle intervention over 2 years in older adults at high risk for dementia is significantly efficacious to reduce the risk of progression to cognitive decline.\n\nCITA GO-ON study.

The program aims to promote healthy brain aging, provide tools for incorporating these routines into daily life, and strengthen the social environment. The program is tailored to each participant needs and abilities throughout the study.

Protocol design and recruitment process\n2 Materials and methods\n2.8 Adherence and participant retention\nAdherence is a vital aspect in studies on lifestyle interventions that entail a significant degree of intricacy and impact on the social and familial structure functioning of participants. CITA GO-ON implements specific strategies to promote adherence. During the randomization phase, the study coordinator conducts a face-to-face or telephone/virtual interview with each MD-Int participant to explain all study activities, identify potential obstacles for compliance with programmed interventions and assessments, and schedule workshops and activities. Each participant is provided with a paper form or virtual record of compliance with the intervention activities and study contact information. Separate forms to account for adherence to cognitive intervention (attendance to workshops and completion of individual home exercises), socio-emotional (attendance to workshops and completion of individual home exercises), physical activities (self-reported completion of prescribed activities), risk factor control (attendance to follow-up visits), and dietary intervention (attendance to workshops) will be collected. This will allow separate analysis of the association of adherence to each intervention and efficacy. The group leader or study coordinator assesses this register at every follow-up visit. After each group session, time is dedicated to addressing any doubts, issues, or challenges the participants may have. Furthermore, group leaders review the group activity plan and schedule for subsequent study activities. The variables included in \"Nutritional Evaluation I\" and \"Physical Activity &amp; Exercise Evaluation I\" are surrogate markers for self-reported adherence. In this sense, the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener, the MEDAS questionnaire, the SPPB, the 6 m walking speed test, cardiovascular factors (blood pressure), and body anthropometry, measured every 4 months, will help us understand if intervention activities are changing participants' lifestyles and will help us detect nonadherence situations.\nParticipants are permitted to bring a close relative to the nutritional and show cooking group meetings, mainly if they are not responsible for preparing the daily meal menu at home cooking.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/441", "#/texts/442"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "22bd2490-b9e1-4989-ab00-94adac478d88"}

The sample size has been calculated to allow a predicted 20% dropout rate according to the GZ study data. In the same way, considering the same level of significance, statistical power, and dropout rate, in order to detect a decline in performance on the mNTB score after 2 years, considering data from the GOIZ ZAINDU Pilot study, we calculated that a sample size of 802 randomized participants would be sufficient to detect by a two tailed Student t test, a difference between groups of 0.10 units in global mNTB score change, considering a 0.33 standard deviation.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/444", "#/texts/445", "#/texts/448", "#/texts/449", "#/texts/450", "#/texts/451", "#/texts/452"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "04af9b78-0557-4df3-8f9b-253dbdaafd8c"}

The model will compare two cloned cohorts that had slight differences in progression to dementia according to whether they received the multidomain intervention. It will calculate costs in Euros (\u20ac) in each cohort and utility in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Finally, the incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) will be estimated by dividing the incremental cost (Ca-Cb) by the incremental utility (Ua-Ub). The time horizon will be the lifetime of the patient. A 3% discount rate will be applied to costs and effectiveness. As the main economic impact of dementia is related to the care required as patients become dependent, a societal perspective will be used. Therefore, we will consider direct and indirect costs (\nLopez-Bastida et al., 2006\n), Data for model parameterization will be mainly obtained from the CITA GO-ON study, although some parameters to build the model will be taken from the literature. The NTBm and functional scales (A-IADL-Q) will be used to obtain the model parameters that determine the progression of dementia from the pre-MCI stage to more advanced stages of the disease according to A-IADL-Q cut-off points (MCI\nDubbelman et al., 2022\n), die from the disease, or die from other causes. Mixed models for repeated measures allow the progression of the scales to be reproduced over time and will be used to simulate the trajectories of real patients (\nMar et al., 2020\n). The model will reflect the improvement introduced by the effectiveness of the intervention in patients to the extent that those treated with multimodal intervention delay their evolution to dementia and improve their health-related quality of life score. We have constructed a preliminary version of the model using a synthetic database. The result has been cross-validated with other nine models within the International Pharmaco-Economic Collaboration on Alzheimer's Disease (IPECAD) collaboration (\nHandels et al., 2025\n).", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/470", "#/texts/471", "#/texts/472", "#/texts/473", "#/texts/474", "#/texts/475", "#/texts/476", "#/texts/477", "#/texts/478", "#/texts/479", "#/texts/480"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "385d11a4-ccf5-43a5-ac2a-08dc59ea6063"}

A community based multidomain lifestyle intervention to prevent cognitive decline. Protocol design and recruitment process\n3 Results\nIn July 2021, the CITA GO-ON trial was launched, along with an educational campaign targeting healthy aging practices in the Gipuzkoa region. The campaign was directed towards the capital city of San Sebastian and three smaller municipalities, Deba, Beasain, and Irun. An informational initiative was reached through the direct mail of over 110,000 citizens aged 60 years and above. A robust media presence, including local newspaper advertisements and radio segments, complemented the campaign. Moreover, up to 30 presentations were delivered to neighborhood associations in the specified locales, with a focus on healthy aging and dementia prevention.\nThe campaign culminated in January 2024, with a preliminary screening of 4,627 individuals via an online survey. Of these, 2,189 people were selected for an in-person screening visit. By this moment, 1736 participants were informed about the study and signed an informed consent form. Of these, 1,051 (60%) were selected for the study (\nFigure 3\n). The recruitment phase has concluded in autumn 2024. There were no significant differences (\np\n= 0.062) between participants' self-reported mean CAIDE dementia risk score calculated using the online form [mean, (SD); 7.23 (1.77)] and the in-score calculated at the screening visit [mean, (SD); 76.98 (1.70)]. This finding indicates that the online form may be a reliable tool for assessing the risk of dementia.\nFigure 3\nFigure 3\n. CITA GO-ON study recruitment process CONSORT flowchart.\nIn the ongoing CITA GO-ON trial Intervention period, 465 individuals have been allocated to the Group 1-Regular Health Advice (RHA) group, and 455 have been assigned to the Group 2-Multidomain Intervention (MD-Int) group. Baseline assessments revealed that a substantial majority (approximately 95%) of the participants randomly selected for the trial exhibited modifiable dementia risk factors as identified by their Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging, and Dementia (CAIDE) score.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/482", "#/texts/483", "#/texts/484", "#/texts/485", "#/texts/486", "#/texts/487", "#/texts/488", "#/texts/489", "#/texts/490", "#/texts/491"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "d89671e5-4a5d-4e5a-b657-8dda66e472f4"}

A community based multidomain lifestyle intervention to prevent cognitive decline. Protocol design and recruitment process\n4 Discussion\nThe CITA GO-ON Study is a lifestyle intervention efficacy trial conducted in Southern Europe, which aims to replicate the findings of the FINGER study and ascertain its reproducibility across diverse global populations. It is part of the broader World-Wide FINGERS network (\nKivipelto et al., 2018b\n,\n2020\n), which includes similar initiatives in Latin America (\nCrivelli et al., 2023\n), Singapore (\nChew et al., 2021\n), the United States (\nBaker et al., 2024\n) and others (\nMoon et al., 2025\n;\nR\u00f6hr et al., 2021\n;\nSugimoto et al., 2021\n;\nDeckers et al., 2024\n;\nFeldman et al., 2023\n;\nGardener et al., 2024\n;\nKumagai et al., 2023\n). The CITA GO-ON study's main protocol emanates from a collaborative effort among leading researchers and institutions within our region in each of the intervention domains and the exploratory variables of the study.\nIn alignment with the FINGER trial methodology (\nNgandu et al., 2014\n), the CITA GO-ON study mirrors its inclusion protocols and outcomes yet diverges in its recruitment strategy. Unlike the FINGER trial, which relied on prior health registries, recruitment in the CITA GO-ON has been community-based. This population-oriented approach is an efficient strategy for identifying adults with modifiable risk factors of dementia and cognitive decline. Our delineation of a \"cognitively frail\" population was based on the combination of an increased dementia risk profile, as measured by the CAIDE risk score and the presence of early cognitive changes including MCI. These are characterized by relevant subjective memory complaints corroborated by consistent accounts or cognitive performance that falls short of expectations in brief cognitive assessments. Based on this approach, we already observed in the GOIZ ZAINDU pilot study that the greatest effect on cognition is produced in executive and processing speed function, which is consistent with previously reported data from the FINGER trial. We understand that a more prolonged intervention period and a larger sample study will might help us to expand this evidence.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/499", "#/texts/500", "#/texts/501", "#/texts/502", "#/texts/503", "#/texts/504", "#/texts/505", "#/texts/506", "#/texts/507", "#/texts/508", "#/texts/509", "#/texts/510", "#/texts/511", "#/texts/512", "#/texts/513", "#/texts/514", "#/texts/515", "#/texts/516", "#/texts/517", "#/texts/518", "#/texts/519", "#/texts/520", "#/texts/521", "#/texts/522", "#/texts/523", "#/texts/524", "#/texts/525", "#/texts/526"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "7aa3a5bb-36e7-4496-bf36-5007c3725806"}

A community based multidomain lifestyle intervention to prevent cognitive decline. Protocol design and recruitment process\n4 Discussion\nPrevious lifestyle intervention studies aimed at dementia prevention underscored the critical nature of participant selection (\nvan Charante et al., 2016\n;\nAndrieu et al., 2017\n), indicating that unselected participants may harbor a similar dementia risk profile to their selected counterparts (\nLicher et al., 2023\n). Consequently, by adhering to stringent inclusion criteria, the CITA GO-ON study ensured that the chosen participants exhibited elevated scores on the CAIDE dementia risk index and inferior results on brief cognitive tests (\nTable 5\n).\nThe main protocol of the CITA GO-ON trial, which does not exhaustively delineate them, is comprehensive enough to accommodate ancillary studies. These potential studies will investigate various topics, including alterations in fluid biomarkers, the effects of APOE genotype, blood DNA methylation, sleep quality and quantity and, and a preliminary assessment of the influence of virtual coaches on follow-up.\nBlood sample collection and neuroimaging acquisition are conducted in a subgroup of participants who have consented to it (\nFigure 2\n). At this point, we have obtained over 700 MRI and blood samples from study participants. This representative subgroup of the study will help us analyze multimodal biomarkers (biofluids and structural neuroimaging). The aim is to evaluate the intervention's biological impact and identify subjects with a specific clinical-biological phenotype who will benefit most from the intervention. The biofluid samples are not limited to plasma or epigenetic markers. They will include proteomic analyses and explore future options such as metabolomics, genomics, or biomarkers of vascular/synaptic damage. MRI acquisition pre-and post-intervention will assess brain changes, with the possibility of integrating other methods in later phases. This effort is made to create a multimodality unified platform that combines clinical data, biomarkers, and \"omics\" strategies to analyze the interaction between modifiable risk factors and pathophysiological processes in people at risk of dementia.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/527", "#/texts/528", "#/texts/529", "#/texts/530", "#/texts/531", "#/texts/532", "#/texts/533", "#/texts/534", "#/texts/535", "#/texts/536", "#/texts/537", "#/texts/538", "#/texts/539"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "006e3a60-032d-4119-abc2-b7e883d75b0f"}

A community based multidomain lifestyle intervention to prevent cognitive decline. Protocol design and recruitment process\n4 Discussion\n4.1 Limitations\nThere are some inherent limitations to this type of trials that we have tried to overcome with the study design. Recruitment from a single center for the required sample size represents a significant challenge, demanding innovative strategies to enhance communication and dissemination activities, which are not typically within the realm of clinicians and researchers. This manuscript underscores such innovative strategies, as engaging directly with the target population has led to the development of a more effective study protocol tailored to the specific needs and demands of the population. To ensure the project's sustainability and the efficient use of resources, the participants were allocated into four waves of 250 individuals for the randomization phase, thereby optimizing resource allocation and preventing resource dilution during periods of low recruitment and overburden during high participants turnout.\nAnother limitation regarding the recruitment process is the healthy volunteer bias. For that reason, we have included the presence of modifiable dementia risk factors as inclusion criteria; for that reason, we have lost approximately 45% of the interested subjects (\nFigure 3\n). Finally, the online prescreening questionnaire may have lost older adults who are digitally illiterate. However, we have made great efforts to avoid it, providing a telephone number in the mass mailing as an alternative. In order to reach communities with poorer communications or poorer accessibility, we also scheduled community talks in rural areas. One of the most challenging issues to achieve in this type of study is blinding. To reduce the impact of this factor, the neuropsychologists responsible for evaluating the primary outcome were not aware of participant assignment to intervention groups, and participants were encouraged not to comment on program details during study visits.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/541", "#/texts/542", "#/texts/543", "#/texts/544"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "5da2a41c-2cb1-46ff-a384-5ba5d6949a98"}
