Cognitive domains were assessed using the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale, and suicidal ideation was evaluated using the Geriatric Mental State-Automated Geriatric Examination for Computer Assisted Taxonomy (GMS-AGECAT) package. Multiple logistic regression and network analyses were conducted to examine the relationships between cognitive domains and suicidal ideation.\n\nThe association between cognitive domains and suicidal ideation in patients with mild dementia: the crucial role of judgement domain\nAbstract\nResults\nThe prevalence of suicidal ideation was significantly higher in mild dementia patients (10.6%) compared to non-dementia individuals (2.1%). Mild dementia was independently associated with suicidal ideation (adjusted OR\u2009=\u20093.37, 95%CI: 1.83-6.19), even after controlling for depression and anxiety. Among cognitive domains, judgment impairment showed the strongest independent association with suicidal ideation (OR\u2009=\u20093.44, 95%CI: 1.49-7.95). Network analysis confirmed judgment domain as the key cognitive factor linking dementia to suicidal ideation, contrasting with multiple domain associations in non-dementia individuals.\n\nThe association between cognitive domains and suicidal ideation in patients with mild dementia: the crucial role of judgement domain\nAbstract\nConclusions\nJudgment domain impairment plays a crucial and independent role in suicidal ideation among mild dementia patients, with more than half of the dementia-suicide association remaining significant even after accounting for emotional symptoms. While anxiety and depression are important concurrent factors requiring clinical attention, the fundamental role of cognitive decision-making capacity suggests that interventions targeting judgment enhancement should be considered as a primary approach in suicide prevention efforts for this population. Further research is needed to develop and validate interventions specifically targeting judgment enhancement while concurrently managing emotional symptoms in the context of dementia care.\nPeer Review reports", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/49", "#/texts/51", "#/texts/53", "#/texts/54"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "3210b724-401c-483b-9eb0-d9f039cb97d0"}

According to recent epidemiological data, the prevalence of dementia in Chinese older adults has reached 5.6%, with an upward trend [\n17\n,\n19\n]. This growing population faces unique challenges in mental health care, particularly in resource-limited regions where traditional family structures and cultural values remain deeply entrenched. In these areas, older adults often occupy pivotal roles as family decision-makers and moral authorities. Cognitive decline-particularly in domains such as judgment-may thus trigger profound psychological distress by undermining these culturally sanctioned roles, potentially escalating suicide risk [\n23\n,\n32\n].\nEmerging evidence underscores cognitive impairment as a critical determinant of suicide risk in older adults [\n14\n]. While studies have linked dementia to suicidal ideation [\n8\n], the specific contributions of distinct cognitive domains remain poorly understood. This gap is particularly salient in mild dementia, where patients retain sufficient awareness to experience the psychological burden of their diagnosis yet exhibit varied cognitive deficits [\n24\n]. Prevailing research has focused on global cognitive decline as a risk factor, neglecting domain-specific mechanisms [\n12\n,\n14\n]. From a biopsychosocial perspective, cognitive impairment may elevate suicide risk through multiple pathways: biologically, prefrontal cortex degeneration may directly impair decision-making; psychologically, compromised problem-solving ability may escalate feelings of helplessness; socio-culturally, the loss of family authority may trigger profound identity crises [\n23\n,\n29\n].", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/56", "#/texts/57", "#/texts/58", "#/texts/59", "#/texts/60", "#/texts/61", "#/texts/62", "#/texts/63", "#/texts/64", "#/texts/65", "#/texts/66", "#/texts/67", "#/texts/68", "#/texts/69", "#/texts/70", "#/texts/71", "#/texts/72", "#/texts/73", "#/texts/74", "#/texts/75", "#/texts/76", "#/texts/77", "#/texts/78", "#/texts/79", "#/texts/80", "#/texts/81", "#/texts/82", "#/texts/83"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "f9004291-9e9a-4d72-90da-e3106c7ca147"}

While depression has been consistently identified as strongly associated with suicidal ideation [\n16\n,\n25\n], anxiety has emerged as an equally important but less studied factor in the dementia-suicide relationship. Both emotional symptoms are prevalent in dementia patients and show strong associations with suicidal thoughts. However, the exact role of these emotional symptoms in the relationship between cognitive impairment and suicide risk-whether as a confounder, mediator, or independent parallel pathways- remains to be clarified [\n12\n]. More importantly, it is unclear whether cognitive domain impairments show independent associations with suicide risk beyond what can be explained by emotional symptoms alone. Understanding these relationships is especially crucial given China's significant burden of geriatric suicide [\n31\n].\nExisting screening tools, such as the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), lack sensitivity to domain-specific impairments [\n14\n]. The Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale addresses this limitation by assessing six cognitive domains, including judgment and problem-solving-a dimension critically aligned with the decision-making demands of rural Chinese family dynamics [\n18\n]. Unlike domains measuring daily functioning (e.g., household chores), judgment deficits directly threaten the elder's symbolic role as a family decision-maker, a cornerstone of Confucian cultural values [\n18\n]. This domain-specific approach may better capture culturally relevant cognitive deficits, offering a nuanced lens to examine suicide risk pathways.\nThis study aims to bridge these gaps by investigating the domain-specific contributions of cognitive impairment to suicidal ideation in older adults with mild dementia, with a focus on resource-limited settings of China. We hypothesize that judgment domain deficits show the strongest independent association with suicide risk among cognitive factors, even after accounting for anxiety and depressive symptoms, although these emotional symptoms may demonstrate stronger overall associations with suicidal ideation.

Anxiety was identified using the GMS-AGECAT, with six levels of diagnostic confidence for anxiety that range from no symptoms (0) to very severely affected (5). Participants who reached level three in the GMS/AGECAT were considered to be anxiety cases [\n6\n,\n27\n].

These converging findings suggest that judgment and executive functions serve as a 'cognitive buffer' against suicidal behavior [\n7\n].

The prominence of anxiety in our findings aligns with emerging research suggesting that anxiety disorders are highly prevalent in dementia and may be more directly linked to cognitive awareness and anticipatory distress about functional decline. Unlike depression, which may develop as a reactive response to loss, anxiety in dementia often reflects the individual's preserved insight into their declining capabilities and uncertain future. This distinction has important implications for intervention strategies, as anxiety-focused interventions may need to address cognitive concerns and uncertainty management, while depression interventions may focus more on mood regulation and behavioral activation. The remaining 51.2% of the association suggests that other factors, particularly cognitive impairments including judgment deficits, play crucial roles in the dementia-suicide relationship. This suggests that while emotional symptom management is crucial, cognitive-focused interventions should be integrated with, rather than secondary to, emotional symptom management.\nFrom a public health perspective, integrating judgment domain evaluations into routine dementia care protocols is crucial. Regular screenings should be prioritized for patients, particularly in resource-limited settings like Tongliao City, where healthcare access may be limited. Additionally, family-centered training programs that include role-playing modules on collaborative decision-making can help alleviate the pressure placed on elderly individuals with dementia. These training programs should be designed to help families understand the importance of adjusting expectations and reframing elders' roles as \"consultants\" rather than primary decision-makers.\nGiven the strong associations of anxiety with suicidal ideation in our study, screening protocols should give equal, if not greater, attention to anxiety symptoms alongside traditional depression screening. Anxiety management interventions, including cognitive-behavioral therapy adapted for mild cognitive impairment, mindfulness-based stress reduction, and pharmacological approaches when appropriate, should be integrated into comprehensive care plans.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/224", "#/texts/225", "#/texts/226"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "2140985c-922d-416f-be38-889c775d7b30"}

Such community-based initiatives could be pivotal in reducing suicidal ideation in resource-limited settings like Tongliao City, where access to specialized care may be limited.\nWhile this study provides valuable insights, several limitations should be acknowledged and addressed in future research. The cross-sectional design precludes causal inferences, necessitating longitudinal studies that track the evolving relationship between cognitive decline and suicidal ideation over time, potentially using structural equation modeling. Our study did not comprehensively examine mediating factors; thus, future research should explore the roles of social support systems, family dynamics, quality of life, and psychological factors such as impulsivity and emotional dysregulation. Dimensional measures of depression severity, cognitive impairment, and suicidal intent are needed to examine dose-response relationships for more nuanced risk stratification. Given the distinct neuropathological features of different dementia subtypes, examining whether judgment impairment and suicidal ideation vary across these subtypes would be valuable. Additionally, qualitative interviews with patients and caregivers should complement quantitative approaches to reveal subjective experiences of cognitive decline and its impact on suicidal thoughts. Finally, developing and testing culturally tailored interventions, particularly those targeting judgment enhancement and emotional symptoms management, would be crucial in resource-limited settings like Tongliao City and other diverse cultural contexts.\nIn conclusion, this study establishes that judgment domain impairment plays a crucial and independent role in suicidal ideation among mild dementia patients. While emotional symptoms, particularly anxiety, show the strongest overall associations and mediate nearly half (48.8%) of the dementia-suicide relationship, cognitive factors-especially judgment impairment-account for the remaining association. These findings have important implications for clinical practice and public health policy, particularly in rapidly aging societies like China. Interventions targeting both cognitive function and emotional symptom management are urgently needed to address factors associated with suicide ideation among older adults with dementia. Further research should focus on developing and validating interventions specifically targeting judgment enhancement and anxiety management, while considering the cultural context of caregiving and dementia in resource-limited settings of China.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/227", "#/texts/228", "#/texts/229"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "ada0982b-21a7-494c-a42d-d8bd23d176f8"}
