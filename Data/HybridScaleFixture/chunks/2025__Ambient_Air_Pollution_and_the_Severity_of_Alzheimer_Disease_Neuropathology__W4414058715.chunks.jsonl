A path diagram of the structural equation modelling shows relationships among PM 2.5 exposure, ADNC, and CDR-SB with 1-year average PM 2.5 exposure before last CDR assessment prior to death as the exposure variable, ordinal ADNC level as the potential mediator, and CDR-SB at last assessment prior to death as the outcome variable in the CDR cohort (n=287), after adjusting for sex, age at CDR, race, years of education, and APOE \u03b54 status as confounding variables. In this model, the indirect effect is the effect of PM 2.5 exposure on CDR-SB through ADNC and the direct effect is the effect of PM 2.5 exposure on CDR-SB that is independent from ADNC. \u03b2 estimates of indirect, direct, and total effects with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated with SEM using a bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap confidence interval method with 2000 simulations. Positive values indicate greater cognitive and functional impairment. This model exhibited good fit indices as follows: comparative fit index [CFI], 0.98; root mean square error of approximation [RMSEA], 0.02; Tucker-Lewis index [TLI], &gt;0.99).\nDiagnostic and assumption tests confirmed both linearity and no spatial autocorrelation for the observed associations in regression models (\neTable 6\nin\nSupplement\n) and the SEM model exhibited good model fit indices (\nFigure 2\n).", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/468", "#/texts/469", "#/texts/470", "#/texts/471", "#/texts/472", "#/texts/473", "#/texts/474", "#/texts/475"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "4d4a25bc-a9a7-4821-a77b-b8d831fa481f"}

First, our clinical research-oriented autopsy cohort is skewed demographically. Indeed, the vast majority of subjects were white, non-Hispanic or Latino, highly educated with a higher than college degree, and/or from less disadvantaged neighborhoods. This biased, unrepresentative sample may limit the generalizability of our findings. Moreover, compared to a population-based study cohort where a diverse spectrum of cognitive and neuropathologic conditions are found,\n39\nour autopsy cohort included a large proportion of cases through research programs that were enriched for AD dementia and that did not enroll individuals with vascular dementia, which may induce selection bias. Due to the rarity of cerebrovascular pathology in our cohort, we likely underestimated the true associations between PM\n2.5\nand cerebrovascular disease which have been strongly supported by epidemiologic studies\n40\n,\n41\n. Moreover, our study included a small number of cases when compared to most epidemiologic studies, precluding a more robust examination of relationships among variables with strong statistical power. Thus, studies of large population-based autopsy cohorts are required in order to extrapolate these findings to the general population.\nSecond, we excluded many cases with missing values due to incomplete assessment. While overall characteristics did not differ between the full versus CDR cohorts, there was a small difference in the mean age at death for those excluded from this study. However, the mean difference of only one or two years is unlikely to be clinically or biologically meaningful. In addition, PM\n2.5\nexposure is associated with increased mortality, and so there is a potential for survivorship bias in this study. Methods such as inverse probability weighting (IPW) may be considered to correct for selection bias such as the impact of conditioning on death and consent to autopsy.\nThird, PM\n2.5\nwas measured only at each case's last residential address. Moving to a new address was not common in our cohort with less than 1% of individuals changing their address within the last year of life.
