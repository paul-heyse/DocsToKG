Geriatric patients in critical care settings pose unique challenges because of their complicated medical problems, fragility, cognitive impairments (such as dementia or delirium), and the increased risks that come with age. In addition, end-of-life care, moral conundrums, and communicating with family members about the prognosis and care objectives sometimes provide emotional difficulties for nurses [\n1\n]. ICU nurses may experience severe stress due to these variables, which can negatively affect their well-being, job performance, and the standard of critically ill geriatric patient care by causing feelings of anxiety and role ambiguity [\n2\n,\n3\n].\nThe Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) paradigm, which contends that personal resources, such as emotional intelligence (EI), assist in counteracting the impacts of job demands, such as role ambiguity, on psychological strain, is used to support the theoretical underpinnings of this study. Emotional intelligence (EI) serves as a psychological tool that helps nurses recognize, comprehend, and successfully handle emotional difficulties in high-stress settings such as essential geriatric care, which in turn lessens anxiety associated with job ambiguity. Thus, by placing the JD-R model inside a well-established occupational stress framework, it strengthens the conceptual contribution of this research and validates the suggested mediating function of EI [\n4\n,\n5\n].\nGlobally, Anxiety disorders cost 2.08% of worldwide healthcare spending annually, making them a serious public health concern [\n6\n]. Nursing professionals, including ICU nurses, have anxiety disorders to differing degrees and in different nations [\n7\n]. According to a prospective longitudinal study, 50% of medical personnel, particularly critical care unit nurses, reported experiencing substantial levels of anxiety during the Italian COVID-19 pandemic [\n8\n]. In Oman, 34.8% of ICU nurses faced anxiety disorders, while in China [\n9\n], 22.3% of ICU nurses reported experiencing anxiety [\n10\n].", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/64", "#/texts/65", "#/texts/66", "#/texts/67", "#/texts/68", "#/texts/69", "#/texts/70", "#/texts/71", "#/texts/72", "#/texts/73", "#/texts/74", "#/texts/75", "#/texts/76", "#/texts/77", "#/texts/78", "#/texts/79", "#/texts/80", "#/texts/81", "#/texts/82", "#/texts/83", "#/texts/84", "#/texts/85", "#/texts/86"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "a5be171b-59ad-4425-9e82-19060883c939"}

Anxiety can contribute to decreased job satisfaction and burnout by affecting communication, emotional resilience, and cognitive functioning. Uncontrolled anxiety has been found to have a detrimental impact on nurses' quality of life, ability to concentrate, and ability to make decisions [\n13\n,\n14\n,\n15\n]. The most prevalent and significant element influencing anxiety at work in nursing practice is role ambiguity [\n16\n]. Role ambiguity is characterized as a state in which nurses lack clarity regarding their job duties, expectations, and boundaries. This condition can cause confusion, stress, and reduced work effectiveness [\n17\n].\nRole ambiguity in the workplace may result from the growing and more complicated duties that nurses currently perform. Uncertainty over nurses' obligations has resulted from overlapping or contradictory tasks and responsibilities and inadequate communication within multidisciplinary healthcare teams [\n18\n,\n19\n]. However, additional factors that contribute to ambiguity in ICU nurses' roles include the absence of knowledge regarding managing critically ill geriatric patients' diseases, the unclear needs of supervisors, and the possible expectations of coworkers [\n20\n]. Additionally, role ambiguity is positively correlated with anxiety, stress, and burnout, according to several research studies [\n21\n,\n22\n]. Role ambiguity adversely affects nurses' mental health because it hinders the efficient execution of tasks, leading to unpleasant feelings, including irritation and worry. Although role ambiguity and anxiety have been investigated previously, the relationship between role ambiguity and anxiety among critical care unit nurses has not received significant attention [\n20\n,\n23\n].", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/87", "#/texts/88", "#/texts/89", "#/texts/90", "#/texts/91", "#/texts/92", "#/texts/93", "#/texts/94", "#/texts/95", "#/texts/96", "#/texts/97", "#/texts/98", "#/texts/99", "#/texts/100", "#/texts/101", "#/texts/102", "#/texts/103", "#/texts/104", "#/texts/105", "#/texts/106", "#/texts/107", "#/texts/108", "#/texts/109", "#/texts/110", "#/texts/111", "#/texts/112", "#/texts/113", "#/texts/114", "#/texts/115", "#/texts/116"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "d51b8a56-9710-45cb-94a7-e944ed05434f"}

EI is essential for ICU nurses caring for critically ill geriatric patients because it helps them better control their emotions, build stronger connections with others, communicate more effectively, cope with stress, and handle job demands. High emotional intelligence ICU nurses are more capable of demonstrating empathy, managing psychological and emotional difficulties, and making wise choices in emergencies [\n25\n]. Numerous researchers have found a strong correlation between emotional intelligence, mental health, and subjective well-being [\n26\n,\n27\n]. According to a longitudinal study's findings, emotional intelligence may help healthcare professionals feel less anxious during stressful situations, such as the COVID-19 pandemic [\n28\n]. Furthermore, emotional intelligence can decrease the negative effects of role ambiguity. Research conducted in Indonesia revealed that emotional intelligence minimized the influence of role ambiguity on employee burnout [\n29\n].\nWhereas previous studies have addressed the impact of role ambiguity and anxiety among ICU nurses, the majority have focused on general nursing populations and ignored psychological mechanisms that may explain this relationship. In particular, the mediating role of EI has received limited attention, especially in the context of geriatric critical care, which presents unique emotional and ethical demands. This study fills this gap by examining Emotional Intelligence (EI) as a mediator between role ambiguity and anxiety among nurses caring for critically ill older adults, offering a novel contribution grounded in the Job Demands-Resources model [\n30\n,\n31\n]. Additionally, there are some studies on anxiety and role ambiguity [\n1\n,\n2\n]. Nevertheless, there is a dearth of studies on how role ambiguity and emotional intelligence affect anxiety in an intensive care unit.

In high-stress environments like intensive care units, nurses often face significant emotional and psychological challenges due to the complexities of patient care and the inherent uncertainties of their roles. The current study aimed to investigate the role of emotional intelligence as a mediator between anxiety and role ambiguity among nurses caring for critically ill geriatric patients.\nThe current study findings provide a comprehensive overview of nurses' emotional intelligence (EI) across four key dimensions: self-emotion appraisal, emotion regulation, use of emotion, and others' emotion appraisal. These dimensions align with established EI frameworks and offer valuable insights into the emotional competencies of nursing professionals. Self-emotion appraisal, which involves recognizing and understanding one's emotions, shows that most nurses score in the high range [\n35\n]. The non-significant direct path from role ambiguity to anxiety (highlights a complex relationship that may warrant further exploration. This finding contradicts prior literature, suggesting that emotional intelligence may play a more significant role in buffering the effects of role ambiguity than previously understood [\n36\n].\nThis ability is crucial for nurses, as it forms the foundation for effective emotional management in high-stress clinical environments. Research has shown that nurses with strong self-emotion appraisal are better equipped to handle the emotional demands of their profession, leading to improved job satisfaction and reduced burnout [\n37\n].\nEmotion regulation demonstrates even higher proficiency among nurses. This skill is vital in nursing, where maintaining professional composure in emotionally charged situations is essential. A previous study has indicated that nurses with superior emotion regulation skills are more resilient to stress and can better provide high-quality patient care [\n38\n]. Moreover, the emotion dimension, which involves harnessing emotions to facilitate performance, shows the highest percentage of nurses in the high category. This denotes that most nurses can use emotions to enhance their clinical abilities and decision-making processes. Supporting the current result, it was previously found that using emotions can lead to improved critical thinking and clinical performance among nurses [\n39\n].", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/258", "#/texts/259", "#/texts/260", "#/texts/261", "#/texts/262", "#/texts/263", "#/texts/264", "#/texts/265", "#/texts/266", "#/texts/267", "#/texts/268", "#/texts/269", "#/texts/270", "#/texts/271"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "aa06fbbd-874a-4637-b113-a52a74c5e509"}

This skill is fundamental for empathetic patient care and effective communication with patients, families, and colleagues. Studies have demonstrated that nurses with strong abilities in this area tend to have better therapeutic relationships with patients and improved teamwork with colleagues [\n17\n,\n40\n,\n41\n]. The overall emotional intelligence scores indicate that a significant majority of nurses demonstrate high total EI. This is encouraging, as high EI has been associated with numerous positive outcomes in nursing practice, including enhanced quality of care, improved patient satisfaction, and better stress management.\nThe data indicate a significant prevalence of anxiety among nurses, with varying degrees of severity ranging from minimal to severe anxiety. The findings reveal that a substantial portion of nurses experience mild anxiety, which is the most frequently reported level. This shows that many nurses are grappling with anxiety that, while not classified as severe, may still impact their overall well-being and job performance. Mild anxiety can lead to increased stress and may affect decision-making and interpersonal relationships within the healthcare team. Research has shown that anxiety among healthcare workers can lead to burnout and decreased job satisfaction, ultimately affecting patient care quality [\n42\n].\nThe presence of moderate and severe anxiety levels among a notable percentage of nurses is particularly concerning. Moderate anxiety can hinder a nurse's ability to perform effectively, while severe anxiety may lead to significant impairment in daily functioning. Studies have indicated that high levels of anxiety in healthcare professionals can result in increased absenteeism, reduced productivity, and a higher likelihood of making errors in patient care [\n43\n]. The mental health of nurses is critical not only for their well-being but also for the safety and quality of care provided to patients. This is especially important in high-stress settings when prompt decision-making and concentrated attention are critical, such as in emergency rooms or intensive care units. Various factors contribute to anxiety among nurses. These may include challenging work environments, lack of human resources, ongoing changes in patient care delivery, and the emotional demands of the profession [\n44\n].", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/272", "#/texts/273", "#/texts/274", "#/texts/275", "#/texts/276", "#/texts/277", "#/texts/278", "#/texts/279", "#/texts/280", "#/texts/281", "#/texts/282", "#/texts/283", "#/texts/284", "#/texts/285", "#/texts/286"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "09d469fb-be91-472a-b581-ada50c4cf835"}

Addressing these structural factors is essential for mitigating role ambiguity and its associated anxiety. Strong leadership, clear communication channels, and well-defined policies are vital in creating an environment where nurses understand their roles and responsibilities [\n36\n]. This organizational support is crucial for fostering a work environment that clarifies expectations and reduces uncertainty.\nThe findings show that many nurses experience low work method ambiguity regarding role ambiguity. This indicates they clearly understand the procedures and methods required in their roles. Clarity in work methods is crucial as it allows nurses to perform their tasks efficiently and confidently, reducing the likelihood of errors and enhancing patient care quality. Research has demonstrated that role clarity is associated with lower stress levels and higher job satisfaction among healthcare professionals [\n45\n].\nSimilarly, the data on scheduling ambiguity reveals that most nurses report low levels of uncertainty regarding their work schedules. This clarity is vital for maintaining work-life balance and ensuring nurses can effectively manage their personal and professional responsibilities. It was previously reported that predictable work schedules contribute to job satisfaction and reduce burnout, which is particularly important in the demanding field of nursing [\n46\n]. While most nurses report low-performance ambiguity, there is still a notable percentage experiencing moderate to high levels of uncertainty regarding performance expectations. This aspect is critical, as unclear performance expectations can lead to anxiety and decreased job performance. A previous study indicates that role ambiguity can negatively impact job satisfaction and increase the likelihood of burnout among nurses [\n47\n].\nRegarding the relationship between the study variables, the findings illustrate the negative correlation between emotional intelligence and anxiety, indicating that higher levels of emotional intelligence are associated with lower anxiety levels among nurses. This finding aligns with existing research demonstrating how emotional intelligence equips individuals with the skills to effectively manage stress and emotional challenges [\n48\n]. Nurses with higher emotional intelligence are better able to navigate the emotional demands of their roles, leading to reduced feelings of anxiety [\n49\n].

This relationship is critical, as it points out that emotionally intelligent nurses are more capable of understanding and clarifying their roles and responsibilities. By effectively managing their emotions and empathizing with colleagues, these nurses can foster better communication and teamwork, reducing uncertainty regarding job roles. Research supports the notion that emotional intelligence enhances role clarity, improving job satisfaction and performance among healthcare professionals [\n50\n].\nThe negative correlation between anxiety and role ambiguity further emphasizes the implications of these findings. As anxiety levels decrease, role ambiguity also diminishes, denoting that when nurses feel more confident and less anxious, they can better define and understand their roles. This relationship is particularly relevant in nursing, where role ambiguity can increase stress and job dissatisfaction. Studies have indicated that reducing role ambiguity through clear communication and defined expectations can alleviate anxiety, promoting a healthier work environment for nurses [\n1\n,\n47\n].\nThe linear regression analysis reveals that both emotional intelligence and role ambiguity are important predictors of anxiety levels among nurses, with emotional intelligence showing a notable impact. The regression analysis demonstrates that emotional intelligence has a significant negative relationship with anxiety. This shows that as emotional intelligence increases, anxiety levels decrease. The unstandardized coefficient for emotional intelligence indicates that anxiety decreases by a certain amount for each unit increase in emotional intelligence. This finding is consistent with existing literature, which posits that higher emotional intelligence enables nurses to manage stress and emotional challenges better, thereby reducing anxiety levels [\n51\n]. Emotional intelligence equips nurses with the skills to navigate the emotional demands of their roles, leading to improved mental health outcomes.\nIn addition to emotional intelligence, role ambiguity also significantly predicts anxiety levels. The regression results indicate that higher levels of role ambiguity are associated with increased anxiety among nurses. This relationship underscores the importance of clear role definitions and expectations in nursing.

While adequate for the statistical analyses, the sample size may not fully represent the diversity of the nursing workforce, particularly in terms of experience levels and specializations. Moreover, the study's cross-sectional design restricts the ability to draw causal inferences regarding the relationships between emotional intelligence, anxiety, and role ambiguity. Additionally, the regression model accounted for only 13.1% of the variance in anxiety, indicating that other influential factors may not have been captured. Future research should consider incorporating additional variables such as workload, organizational support, and other contextual or psychological factors to provide a more comprehensive understanding of anxiety in this setting.

Firstly, healthcare organizations should implement structured training programs to enhance emotional intelligence (EI) among nursing staff. These programs should span 4-6 weeks, with weekly sessions of 1-2 h each. The curriculum should focus on developing essential skills in self-emotion appraisal, emotion regulation, and empathetic communication. Additionally, incorporating evidence-based practices such as mindfulness techniques and effective communication workshops will further equip nurses to navigate the emotional demands of their roles more effectively.\nSecondly, it is crucial to address systemic issues contributing to role ambiguity within nursing teams. Organizations should establish clear job descriptions, expectations, and communication channels to reduce confusion and enhance role clarity. Regular team meetings and feedback sessions can facilitate better understanding and collaboration among staff, thereby minimizing uncertainty and improving job satisfaction. This approach acknowledges that role ambiguity is often rooted in poor leadership and unclear policies, which must be addressed to create a supportive work environment.\nAdditionally, organizations should consider providing comprehensive mental health support services, including counseling and tailored stress management workshops. These services will help nurses cope with anxiety and stress, particularly in high-pressure settings like intensive care units. Supporting nurses' mental health is essential for fostering a healthier work environment and ensuring that they can perform their duties effectively.\nFinally, future research should explore the long-term effects of emotional intelligence training on nurse well-being and patient care outcomes. Investigating the role of other potential mediators or moderators in the relationship between emotional intelligence, anxiety, and role ambiguity is also vital. This includes examining how structural factors influence these dynamics, which could lead to more effective interventions in the future. By promoting structured emotional intelligence training, addressing systemic issues related to role ambiguity, and providing robust mental health support, healthcare systems can significantly enhance the well-being of nurses, ultimately leading to improved quality of patient care.\n\nEmotional intelligence as a mediator of anxiety and role ambiguity among nurses caring for critically ill geriatric patients\nData availability\nThe datasets used or analyzed in this study are available from the corresponding author upon request.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/338", "#/texts/339", "#/texts/340", "#/texts/341", "#/texts/343"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "03f9d95a-c665-4a62-8bf4-a97335a20ead"}
