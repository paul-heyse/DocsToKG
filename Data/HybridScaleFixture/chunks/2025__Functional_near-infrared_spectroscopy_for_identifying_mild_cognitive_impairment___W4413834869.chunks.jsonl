Of these, 4 studies employed both resting-state and task-based paradigms, 11 studies focused on resting-state paradigms, and 43 studies utilized task-based paradigms. Resting-state studies revealed reduced brain activation in the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes in AD and MCI patients, along with significant reductions in tissue oxygenation index (TOI) and functional connectivity (FC). Task-based studies demonstrated diminished activation across multiple brain regions during cognitive tasks, with reduced FC intensity and signal complexity in AD and MCI patients.

Studies suggest that 15-20% of individuals aged 65 and above exhibit MCI, with approximately 10-15% progressing to AD annually, and 30-33% converting within 2-5 years (\n2\n,\n3\n). On average, individuals diagnosed with AD survive 4 to 8 years following the onset of symptoms. Pathologically, AD is characterized by the accumulation of beta-amyloid plaques and tau proteins tangles, which disrupt neuronal signaling and lead to neuronal death, consequently causing cognitive decline (\n4\n). Given that therapeutic interventions initiated during the MCI phase have been demonstrated to significantly decelerate the progression to AD (\n2\n,\n5\n), early and accurate diagnosis of both AD and MCI is of critical importance. While several reviews have synthesized fNIRS applications in neurodegenerative diseases (\n6\n,\n7\n), this study focuses specifically on refining diagnostic differentiation between MCI and AD through task/resting-state paradigms and machine learning advancements. Our analysis extends the temporal scope to February 2024, capturing new studies published after the cutoff date of Butters et al. (\n6\n) and emphasising the use of hemodynamic biomarkers for the early identification of patients.\nImaging modalities such as positron emission tomography (PET), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) have demonstrated effectiveness in identifying AD and MCI (\n8\n,\n9\n). However, these imaging methods are not without limitations-they are time-consuming, expensive, and often inaccessible for early diagnosis in many patients. Additionally, SPECT and PET involve the injection of radioactive compounds, exposing individuals to ionizing radiation, which makes them unsuitable for routine screening. fMRI, while non-invasive, requires subjects to remain immobile in an enclosed, noisy environment for extended periods, making it challenging for individuals with claustrophobia, noise sensitivity, deafness, or metal implants.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/250", "#/texts/251", "#/texts/252", "#/texts/253", "#/texts/254", "#/texts/255", "#/texts/256", "#/texts/257", "#/texts/258", "#/texts/259", "#/texts/260", "#/texts/261", "#/texts/262", "#/texts/263", "#/texts/264", "#/texts/265", "#/texts/266", "#/texts/267", "#/texts/268", "#/texts/269", "#/texts/270", "#/texts/271", "#/texts/272", "#/texts/273"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "a20aae0d-9de0-4d4c-bd24-56bb4696187d"}

This technology boasts a high temporal resolution of approximately 1 ms and a spatial resolution of about 1 centimeter. By differentiating between the absorption spectra of oxygenated (HbO) and deoxygenated hemoglobin (HbR), fNIRS can accurately capture ongoing hemodynamic changes in the cortical regions. This technique has demonstrated advantages in terms of operational ease, time efficiency, cost-effectiveness, portability, and inclusivity. Notably, fNIRS has been applied in the differentiation of various psychiatric disorders, including depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia (\n10\n,\n11\n), and also MCI and AD (\n12\n).\nThe primary objective of this review is to critically review the application of fNIRS in the study of cognitive impairments, particularly in distinguishing MCI from AD. Given the variability in fNIRS tasks/resting state design employed by contemporary researchers, this review will catalog and analyze the task designs and resting state employed in each relevant study. It is hypothesized that by examining the alterations in oxygenation levels between MCI and AD during both resting and active conditions, fNIRS can demonstrate its strong potential for distinguishing between these two stages of cognitive decline.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/274", "#/texts/275", "#/texts/276", "#/texts/277", "#/texts/278", "#/texts/279", "#/texts/280", "#/texts/281"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "bfcc6a11-f71a-4ce8-9257-faeee4e898be"}

Characteristics of studies reporting resting-state near-infrared spectroscopy date for dementia and MCI.\nTOI is a measure measured using fNIRS and used to assess the balance between oxygen delivery and consumption in tissues. Dynamic vascular reactivity (DVR) reflects cerebrovascular response to metabolic demands, while dynamic cerebral autoregulation (DCA) maintains stable perfusion during blood pressure fluctuations. Five of the studies measured the TOI in MCI, and all of the included studies found that cerebral perfusion was deficient in MCI compared to HC (\n13\n-\n17\n). This provides transparent evidence for the consensus on cerebral hypoperfusion in MCI. Marmarelis and colleagues measured TOI in the prefrontal region with fNIRS and found that patients with MCI had impaired DVR but no abnormalities in DCA (\n15\n). Tarumi and colleagues found that patients with aMCI had smaller volumes of the internal olfactory cortex and lower levels of oxygenation of resting brain tissue, which is associated with memory and executive function (\n16\n). Comparison of the data showed no significant differences between aMCI patients and controls in the dynamic regulation of cerebral blood flow and tissue oxygenation. However, increased cerebral tissue oxygenation and cerebral blood flow velocity transfer function were negatively correlated with memory performance.

Alterations in NC can be monitored by fNIRS, and three papers have utilised the NC mechanism to infer brain activity from haemodynamic signals (\n13\n,\n18\n,\n19\n). Liu and colleagues have found evidence of neurovascular uncoupling in the early stages of aMCI (\n14\n). They described that while there was a positive correlation between CBF and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) in normal controls, no such correlation was observed in patients with aMCI. In a further study, the researchers extracted brain activity and arterial blood pressure signals from fNIRS and ABP measurements and calculated the coupling function between the two signals. This may prove to be a valuable method for detecting MCI (\n13\n). Moreover, one study employed electroencephalography (EEG) and fNIRS, in conjunction with multivariate analysis techniques, to discern neurovascular uncoupling in patients diagnosed with AD. This represents a disruption in the coupling between neural activity and blood supply, which serves to distinguish Alzheimer's disease from the control group (\n19\n).

Functional connectivity (FC) can characterise the internal activity of the brain and reveal synergies between different regions of the brain (\n20\n). Four studies have investigated abnormal dynamic functional connectivity and brain states in MCI patients (\n18\n,\n21\n-\n23\n). Various studies have analysed oxyhaemoglobin signals measured by fNIRS using whole-brain averaging, ROI-based and channel-based methods, or dynamic Bayesian inference (DBI), to evaluate effective connectivity in subjects. Both increase (\n21\n,\n22\n) and decreased (\n18\n,\n23\n) connectivity has been found in the control group compared to the cognitively impaired group. This divergence aligns with the \"neural compensation\" model (\n24\n), where hyperconnectivity delays clinical symptom onset before irreversible network failure. Niu and colleagues used sliding-window correlation and k-means clustering analysis to construct dynamic functional connectivity for each subject. They discovered a significant increase in the strength of brain dynamic FC variability (Q) in the aMCI and AD groups compared to the HC group. Classification performance using Q as a measure demonstrated good ability to differentiate between aMCI or AD and HC (\n22\n). While direction varies (hyper-/hypo-connectivity), 100% of studies (4/4) report abnormal FC dynamics. Increased dynamic FC variability (Q) shows 89% reproducibility as a classifier.\nfNIRS is a technique that measures brain activity by detecting changes in blood flow and oxygenation. In two studies, fNIRS signals from the PFC at rest in patients with cognitive impairment were recorded.

These oscillations serve as biomarkers for cerebrovascular integrity in neurodegenerative diseases. As fNIRS cannot directly measure neural oscillations, concurrent EEG is required for such investigations. The combination of fNIRS with LFO detection enables researchers to investigate the relationship between haemodynamic responses and neural oscillations, thereby providing insights into the communication and coordination of different brain regions across a range of tasks and states. Zeller and colleagues examined patterns of changes in LFO in people with MCI (\n27\n). The results showed an increase in LFOs in the frontal lobe and a decrease in LFOs in the parietal lobe in individuals with MCI.\nMSE is a method used to analyse the complexity of time-series data. The combination of fNIRS with MSE analysis allows researchers to study the complexity and dynamics of brain activity in response to various stimuli or tasks.

A total of 25 studies have explored this concept in patients with cognitive impairment. VFT is a common cognitive activation paradigm that is widely used in dementia and related research. A total of 23 studies have investigated changes in cerebral blood flow during word retrieval using the VFT or an adapted version of it. VFT can be divided into two versions, in a letter task, participants are asked to list words that begin with a particular letter, such as 'A', e.g., apple, add and acre. In a category task, participants are asked to identify words that belong to a particular category, such as 'plants' with fir, willow and cedar. In addition, regional variations in language may influence the choice of words.\nCompared to HC, both MCI (\n24\n,\n29\n-\n39\n) and AD (\n12\n,\n21\n,\n26\n,\n40\n-\n42\n) patients showed poorer brain region activation, and the brain regions most commonly studied are frontal, parietal, and there was also a study that looked at hemodynamic changes in brain regions in the temporal lobe (\n43\n).

Additionally, significant reductions in TOI and FC were observed. Neurovascular uncoupling was evident in both AD and MCI patients, and AD patients showed reduced signal complexity across multiple brain networks. (2) Task-state fNIRS Findings: Task-based fNIRS reveals diminished activation across frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes in AD patients. MCI findings show greater heterogeneity: while reduced activation occurs in advanced stages/high cognitive loads, prefrontal hyperactivation emerges during simpler tasks (\n38\n,\n71\n), suggesting compensatory recruitment to maintain function. This compensatory capacity diminishes with disease progression, yielding AD-like hypoactivation. Healthy controls exhibit strong left-hemisphere lateralization during language/executive tasks-a pattern attenuated in MCI/AD, indicating altered hemispheric specialization. Both groups show reduced functional connectivity and signal complexity, reflecting impaired network integration. (3) Machine Learning Applications: Several studies employed machine learning models based on fNIRS data, yielding promising classification results. Techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), support vector machines (SVM), and random forests achieved high accuracy in distinguishing between healthy individuals, MCI, and AD patients, with some models reaching accuracy rates of 90%.\nOverall, these findings support the utility of fNIRS in investigating the cerebral processes underlying MCI and AD, as well as its potential in early diagnosis.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/508", "#/texts/509", "#/texts/510", "#/texts/511", "#/texts/512", "#/texts/513"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "acdf4139-6c81-4937-a99d-3941e1026d72"}

It does not require complex experimental designs, allowing subjects to remain relaxed, making it particularly suitable for individuals with dementia who may struggle with task-based protocols. However, the fNIRS signals in resting states are relatively weak, making it difficult to detect subtle changes. Additionally, there is significant inter-individual variability in brain activity during rest, complicating data analysis (\n23\n). Individualized baselines are recommended to mitigate this variability. (2) Task-State fNIRS: Task-State fNIRS allows for the targeted activation of specific brain regions, making it easier to localize and measure brain activity. However, this method requires careful experimental planning and strict adherence to the task protocol. In some cases, elderly patients or those with advanced dementia may struggle to perform tasks, affecting data quality. In summary, both methods are valuable but have specific limitations. Resting-state fNIRS is more suited for long-term monitoring and passive assessment, whereas task-based fNIRS is better for active functional mapping but may face challenges with more impaired individuals.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/515", "#/texts/516", "#/texts/517"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "fa1cd8d1-97ac-49c2-b629-ad43658d0111"}

(2) Limited Depth Penetration: fNIRS is limited to measuring cortical surface activity, making it difficult to assess deeper brain structures. (3) Lack of Standardization: There is no standard protocol for fNIRS studies, leading to inconsistencies in subject inclusion criteria, device settings, and task paradigms across studies, which may affect result comparability. (4) Susceptibility to Noise and Artifacts: fNIRS signals are vulnerable to interference from ambient light, physiological signals (e.g., heart rate, respiration), and motion artifacts, which can complicate data interpretation.

To advance its utility, several areas of research should be explored: Algorithm Improvements: Enhancing fNIRS signal processing algorithms could improve the sensitivity and reliability of data interpretation. Probe Design: Developing high-density diffuse optical tomography (HD-DOT) systems with enhanced optode arrays (\u2265128 channels) to achieve cortical depth-resolved imaging. This technology can overcome spatial resolution limitations and improve sensitivity to atrophied brains (\n72\n). Multi-Modal Integration: Exploring the integration of fNIRS with other biomarkers and imaging modalities, such as combining fNIRS with MRI or EEG, could provide a more comprehensive understanding of cognitive impairments. Task Design: Expanding research into visuospatial and motor-related tasks, beyond commonly used paradigms such as the VFT and N-back, could yield new insights into cognitive function in MCI and AD.\nFuture research must prioritize measurement reliability and neurobiological validity to establish fNIRS as a robust clinical tool for MCI/AD. Current limitations in inter-individual variability necessitate enhancing measurement reliability through: (a) standardized test-retest protocols to define fNIRS reliability thresholds (e.g., ICC &gt; 0.8 for clinical utility) (\n73\n); (b) harmonized preprocessing pipelines to improve reproducibility of functional connectivity metrics (\n74\n); and (c) rigorous validation against established rfMRI reliability benchmarks (e.g., within-network FC ICC = 0.4-0.7) (\n75\n). Furthermore, linking hemodynamics to neurobiological validity requires grounding fNIRS biomarkers in neural mechanisms. This involves: integrating fNIRS with the 'dark energy' framework, where spontaneous hemodynamic fluctuations (0.01-0.1 Hz) may mirror the brain's intrinsic energy-consuming processes (\n76\n).", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/523", "#/texts/524", "#/texts/525", "#/texts/526", "#/texts/527", "#/texts/528", "#/texts/529", "#/texts/530", "#/texts/531", "#/texts/532", "#/texts/533", "#/texts/534"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "cc5d6388-3e8d-4d97-b7d4-bc2c0fb6427e"}
