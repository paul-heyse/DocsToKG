However, care home residents, a potentially vulnerable group, are often excluded from research that could directly benefit them. This systematic review examined the existing literature on public involvement approaches in research involving older adults residing in long-term care homes.\n\nResearch collaboration with care home residents: a systematic review of public involvement approaches\nAbstract\nMethods\nA systematic search of CINAHL, MEDLINE and PsychINFO was conducted, using search terms related to public involvement and long-term care. The search was limited to English language papers published from 2014, building on a 2016 review conducted by Backhouse et al. Articles were screened by title and abstract, and full texts of potentially eligible papers were reviewed for inclusion.

Reported public involvement in this setting was limited, with even fewer studies demonstrating genuine collaboration and the full involvement of residents throughout the research process. There was a lack of representation of residents with advanced cognitive decline or dementia. Terminology used to describe public involvement varied considerably across studies, highlighting a lack of clarity in defining and reporting activities.\n\nResearch collaboration with care home residents: a systematic review of public involvement approaches\nAbstract\nConclusions\nThis review highlights the need for greater emphasis on public involvement in care home research, particularly for residents with cognitive impairments.

This can include the understanding of information gained from speaking to residents, staff, family members and the wider community. Recent research has shown the importance of including a range of long-term care residents, including those living with cognitive decline or dementia, which account for up to 80% of residents in long-term care [\n2\n], in research practices [\n3\n]. Long-term care is a 'unique and complex environment' and it is important that the experiences of people living within the environment are considered in research [\n4\n]. Despite this, long-term care residents, particularly those living with a level of cognitive decline remain an under-represented population in long-term care research [\n5\n,\n6\n]. Using more adaptable methods can facilitate research with residents in long-term care [\n7\n]. This includes the overall methodology, for example using ethnographic techniques, which allows for informal conversations during naturally occurring events and immersion within an environment during periods of data collection [\n8\n]. This also includes restructuring research relationships, to include residents and other key stakeholders' input throughout the whole research process, using methods such as co-production, participatory action research (PAR), patient and public involvement (PPI) and patient and public involvement and engagement (PPIE). Involving a full range of stakeholders, and residents in long-term care research is important to enhance the quality and the relevance of the research [\n3\n,\n9\n,\n10\n].", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/53", "#/texts/54", "#/texts/55", "#/texts/56", "#/texts/57", "#/texts/58", "#/texts/59", "#/texts/60", "#/texts/61", "#/texts/62", "#/texts/63", "#/texts/64", "#/texts/65", "#/texts/66", "#/texts/67", "#/texts/68", "#/texts/69", "#/texts/70", "#/texts/71", "#/texts/72", "#/texts/73", "#/texts/74", "#/texts/75"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "a8684ec5-f139-4e9d-9bae-9fae7629d991"}

Given the setting and the holistic nature of care within these environments, where residents may not always primarily identify as'patients'in a medical context, we have chosen to use the term'public involvement'to encompass the broad range of residents'perspectives and experiences. This aligns with the understanding that long-term care is a 'unique and complex environment' where the experiences of all people living within it are important to consider in research. A spectrum of public involvement exists in research, with some highlighting co-production as an 'ideal' practice to be included [\n11\n]. Co-producing research means involvement is incorporated throughout the entirety of the project, including consultation, protocol development and review, input to manuscripts, feedback on research questions, participant materials, editing survey questions, consent forms, information sheets and summaries for readability and providing assistance with recruitment, public engagement and dissemination [\n11\n]. Co-production, along with some other research practices on the public involvement spectrum, involves close collaboration, sharing of power and knowledge and levels of respect and reciprocity between researchers, practitioners and the public, which can lead to lasting relationships [\n12\n]. Also noted as part of the public involvement research spectrum is PAR, which focuses on bringing together a group of people to help improve or solve a known problem with shared relevance. Here, a partnership is created to generate, test, and provide feedback on the solution [\n13\n].\nSeveral existing reviews highlight effective implementation of public involvement. Backhouse et al. [\n3\n] reviewed the feasibility of public involvement with older adults living in long-term care homes and concluded that older residents can be successfully involved in the research process, but there were few examples of care home research where this was achieved. Typically, the studies that achieved more collaborative public involvement practices were smaller scale studies with public involvement practices in larger scale studies confined to advisory roles. Baldwin et al. [\n14\n] reviewed research involving older adults in public involvement in health and social care research. Their study concluded a need for future consideration of older adult's skills and motivation when matching individuals to a project as well as the individual's level of involvement and embedding evaluation into an iterative research process. Both reviews successfully incorporated their own public involvement through reviewing the themes with public involvement team members [\n3\n] and advisory group participants [\n14\n].", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/76", "#/texts/77", "#/texts/78", "#/texts/79", "#/texts/80", "#/texts/81", "#/texts/82", "#/texts/83", "#/texts/84", "#/texts/85", "#/texts/86", "#/texts/87", "#/texts/88", "#/texts/89", "#/texts/90", "#/texts/91", "#/texts/92", "#/texts/93"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "f026e082-3f39-48dc-8a72-fac44107001c"}

[\n15\n] acknowledged limitations stemming from the lack of standardised public involvement reporting guidance and structure, which could have caused missed public involvement reporting in literature. In general, continued under-reporting of public involvement, has been found by Gray et al. [\n16\n] as an ongoing issue. None of the included randomised control trials within their research reported on public involvement activities, meaning they were unable to identify differences recorded in public involvement reporting [\n16\n]. More recent research by Lang et al. [\n17\n] suggested future research could focus on the \"quality of [public involvement] reporting, perhaps based on established criteria\" [\n17\n]. In 2023, a review by Burgher et al. found that implementing a person-centred approach to public involvement could improve stakeholder involvement at different levels. Communication barriers across staff and resident groups in public involvement sessions, for example during the set-up of activities, can make public involvement challenging. In addition, they noted that a gap in including residents with higher needs in terms of functional or cognitive decline was still evident. The additional needs and often time pressured studies presented challenges in bridging this gap in research, which still needs to be addressed [\n9\n]. It should be noted that while resident voices have been included within previous reviews, they were involved to varying degrees within the included papers, with many articles still including no resident voices. The evidence-based public involvement guidelines for future long-term care home research were therefore not specifically tailored to encourage resident involvement [\n9\n]. Overall, it is evident that research papers often report on the process of public involvement more heavily than the impact of the public involvement, which not only hinders learning about the benefits, but risks acceptance of tokenistic public involvement practices [\n18\n]. Furthermore, despite a noticeable increase in the number of public involvement papers being published in recent years, challenges in public involvement still persist [\n19\n].\nPrevious research, including Backhouse et al. [\n3\n] and Burgher et al. [\n9\n], has contributed to the understanding of public involvement in long-term care. This systematic review provides a necessary update to account for more recent literature and has a specific focus on the collaborative involvement and experiences of care home residents themselves.

Regardless of outcomes, buy-in from care home staff and management was noted as either a barrier or facilitator depending on the levels of enthusiasm, with higher buy-in acting as facilitators and lower becoming barriers to Public Involvement activities. Including internal facilitators, varied backgrounds among the research team and stakeholder groups and the research group being known to the care home/organisation helped with both communication and buy-in. External facilitators were found in more than one paper to increase rigour and candidness among older adults joining public involvement activities. Although, researchers with less experience in involving older adults in research were noted as a barrier. Resident health issues (specifically residents living with mild to moderate dementia) and resident tiredness/loss of concentration during focus groups were noted in one paper as a barrier to obtaining information. Additionally, miscommunication and a lack of confidence in residents were also noted as barriers. In general, a lack of evaluation of implementation processes/public involvement activities made it difficult to clearly outline the barriers or facilitators.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/198", "#/texts/199", "#/texts/200", "#/texts/201", "#/texts/202", "#/texts/204", "#/texts/205", "#/texts/206", "#/texts/207", "#/texts/208"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "4fe380ca-f6e6-45cd-afe8-2ed3d454f3c9"}

It aimed to explore the latest key research practice messages from collaborative research involving older adults living in long-term care homes, the barriers and facilitators to this and the skills, resources and planning needed. Multiple terms to describe public involvement have been used across the included studies, with limited expansion on what public involvement activities actually looked like in practice. Resident voices in public involvement were acknowledged as the focus, although half of the included papers still failed to put them at the forefront or standalone of results presented.

The included information was synthesised to explore these aspects.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/211"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "497c453a-3ba2-49db-97cf-46d9e3050184"}

This was also found in the review preceding this by Backhouse et al. [\n3\n], with literature searches concluded 9 years prior to those completed in this review. Coproduction and public involvement with care home residents in research activities in the health and social care sector goes beyond consulting residents and power should shift towards the end users [\n28\n,\n29\n]. Despite coproduction and public involvement activities being described in the included papers, involvement of residents from start to end of the research being conducted was seen in few. Furthermore, there was a distinct lack of residents who were living with advanced cognitive decline or dementia mentioned in the included papers, which reinforces previous research highlighting the underrepresentation of such residents in research activities [\n5\n,\n6\n]. In theory, it is possible for all health and social care research to include public involvement activities with residents, including residents living with dementia. Practically, however, accessibility, health and safety and ethical concerns surrounding potential residents to be included in public involvement activities still limits the level of inclusivity seen. Woelders and Abma [\n26\n] introduced named facilitators, who were found to improve resident involvement in research activities, particularly facilitators who were known members of the care home community, such as spiritual counsellors. This gave residents a platform that encouraged information sharing and problem solving. However, gaps between facilitators and care teams were still evident, which prevented information from residents reaching care teams. Participatory processes increasingly enable resident voices in care home research and the facilitators known to residents stand to enable coproduction and the inclusion of resident voices within the context of a care home setting [\n30\n]. Failure to share information that comes from care home residents, as well as a failure to share research results, can leave residents feeling frustrated and underappreciated. Despite this being acknowledged within the included papers, no clear follow up was mentioned.\nThere is a shortage of public involvement reported in wider health and social care research, but it appears there has been an acceptance of the need to report limitations and the shortcomings of public involvement activities [\n31\n]. Furthermore, reported public involvement activities have low participation rates, or none have been included in the final results presented [\n9\n].", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/213", "#/texts/214", "#/texts/215", "#/texts/216", "#/texts/217", "#/texts/218", "#/texts/219", "#/texts/220", "#/texts/221", "#/texts/222", "#/texts/223", "#/texts/224", "#/texts/225", "#/texts/226", "#/texts/227", "#/texts/228", "#/texts/229", "#/texts/230", "#/texts/231", "#/texts/232"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "807419c3-5d92-4088-b3aa-2d9ed0fbd24e"}

With this limit set, most research presented came from the Netherlands and then from English speaking countries. There was a lack of reporting on public involvement activities, and in fact, some public involvement methodology described were actually research methods, potentially blurring roles between public involvement activities and participants (see Table\n4\n). Therefore, we may not know the full involvement of care home residents within the studies presented and also may have missed other research including resident Public Involvement due to lack of reporting.

[\n3\n] review which it has updated. New evidence shows how residents have been involved, highlighting that resident involvement can be successful when facilitated by independent or external personnel, when they have specific involvement separate from other stakeholders, and when research groups have previous connections with care organisations. However, since the previous search conducted in 2014 only six articles explicitly report involvement of care home residents as public involvement collaborators or advisors. As was highlighted in the Backhouse et al. review, quantitative research involving residents is still lacking, as are larger studies. While public involvement reporting guidelines (GRIPP2) [\n32\n] have been developed, there are still reporting limitations in the included studies, which, in fact, did not report using GRIPP2. Evidence from both reviews demonstrates that older care-home residents can be successfully involved in research processes. This knowledge coupled with increased emphasis from research funders to involve people with lived experience in research, demonstrates that there is clear scope to augment the role of resident involvement. Researchers may feel wary of involving residents due to access and capacity challenges and care-home managers as gatekeepers may feel protective about resident involvement however, findings from both reviews (Table\n3\n) outline clear facilitators for involving care home residents, which will be of practical use to researchers.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/241", "#/texts/242", "#/texts/243", "#/texts/244", "#/texts/245", "#/texts/246", "#/texts/247"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "a20dac9e-beca-4b47-a23e-e7b812f3ede8"}

A broader understanding of what public involvement within research means is needed to aid the identification of relevant papers. Regardless of how successful public involvement activities within research are reported to be, the description and amount of resident involvement is still lacking. Papers highlighting the use of public involvement activities as a strategy for research are still at risk of the tokenistic inclusion of residents, particularly those living with cognitive decline, regardless of steps taken to creatively facilitate inclusivity. Residents and care staff should be included as early as possible in research as part of a co-production design to facilitate the use of public involvement activities, improve resident confidence and increase staff buy-in. Further information on how residents are engaged and how activities are adapted to make them more inclusive for all residents, regardless of needs, is essential to successfully implement future public involvement activities. Future research should also focus on dissemination of results to residents and remuneration, which are currently under-reported.\n\nResearch collaboration with care home residents: a systematic review of public involvement approaches\nData availability\nNo datasets were generated or analysed during the current study.\n\nResearch collaboration with care home residents: a systematic review of public involvement approaches\nAbbreviations\nPPI:\nPublic and Patient Involvement\nNIHR:\nNational Institute for Health and Care Research\nPAR:\nParticipatory Action Research\nNHS:\nNational Health Service\nNICE:\nNational Institute for Health and Care Excellence\nGRIPP2:\nInternational guidance for reporting of patient and public involvement in health and social care research", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/249", "#/texts/251", "#/texts/253", "#/texts/254", "#/texts/255", "#/texts/256", "#/texts/257", "#/texts/258", "#/texts/259", "#/texts/260", "#/texts/261", "#/texts/262", "#/texts/263", "#/texts/264"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "8c3e30b3-f144-4d6d-8b8b-10643dcae85b"}
