Importantly, current diagnostic criteria for AD mark the presence of atypical, nonamnestic neuropsychological symptoms [2]. Among these, apraxia represents a critical cognitive phenotype that warrants further investigation [3] since it impacts the activities of daily living: Apraxia impairs cognitive-motor functions, including gesture imitation, pantomiming object use, and actual object use, and cannot be (solely) attributed to basic motor deficits [4]. Apraxic deficits constitute a core feature of AD that increases in severity [5] as AD progresses. Likewise, the prevalence of apraxic deficits increases from around 30% in mild cases of AD to 90% in severe stages of the disease [3, 6].\nNotably, the presence of (limb) apraxia has been shown to distinguish between AD and frontotemporal dementia [7],", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/9", "#/texts/10", "#/texts/11", "#/texts/12", "#/texts/13", "#/texts/14", "#/texts/15", "#/texts/16", "#/texts/17"], "page_nos": [1], "uuid": "00638e1a-3779-4241-b56a-f2c6fb5f9de5"}

Already in the early stages of AD, apraxia supports the differential diagnosis of Alzheimer's dementia from other dementia subtypes, as AD patients present with distinctive clinical patterns of apraxic deficits [9-11]. In particular, patients with AD exhibited pronounced deficits in imitating hand and finger gestures, whereas patients with frontotemporal dementia showed specific impairments in imitating bucco-facial gestures [9, 10]. In patients with frontotemporal dementia, the AD apraxia profile (i.e. more severe deficits in limb apraxia compared to bucco-facial apraxia) was associated with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)based biomarkers indicative of additional AD pathology [12].\nDespite the documented importance of apraxic deficits in AD, systematic investigations on the frequency and patterns of apraxic deficits in AD remain scarce, particularly in patients with biomarker-verified Alzheimer's pathology. According to the current diagnostic criteria of the National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer's Association (NIADA) [2], the diagnosis of AD includes specific neuropathological markers, namely amyloid\u03b2 (A+) and (phosphorylated) tau (T+), which can be detected in the CSF or in the brain by positron emission tomography (PET) [13]. This biomarker-based definition of AD is considered crucial for reliably distinguishing between AD and other neurodegenerative diseases that can lead to dementia [14].", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/21", "#/texts/22"], "page_nos": [1], "uuid": "ed48d179-6b47-45b8-8b74-6ef91b17d37b"}

To this end, we investigated the frequency and severity of apraxic deficits and their relationship to the patient's cognitive status. Moreover, we probed the presence of differential patterns of praxis deficits (i.e. apraxia profiles) in the patients with Alzheimer's pathology, while controlling for general cognitive deficits. Building on previous studies showing more pronounced deficits in imitating limb gestures than facial gestures in AD patients [9], we further explored putative differential impairments in imitating hand versus finger gestures in patients with biomarker-verified Alzheimer's pathology. Neuropsychological studies in stroke patients have shown that patients with unilateral right hemisphere damage were impaired specifically in the imitation of finger gestures (compared to healthy control subjects). In contrast, patients with unilateral left hemisphere strokes had similar deficits in imitating finger gestures as patients with right hemisphere strokes, but suffered from additional deficits in imitating hand gestures [15]. Since AD pathology typically occurs bilaterally, we hypothesised that the patients with Alzheimer's pathology would be more impaired in imitating finger gestures than hand gestures. We also hypothesised that patients with Alzheimer's pathology would perform worse in\nimitating complex movements compared to single gestures. Besides, we tested whether the effect of movement complexity is modulated by the effector performing the movements (i.e. hand vs. finger). Finally, by investigating whether apraxic deficits predict general cognitive impairment, this study provided insights into the potential predictive value of praxis performance (or deficits thereof) for cognitive functioning in patients with biomarker-verified Alzheimer's pathology.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/23", "#/texts/27"], "page_nos": [1], "uuid": "2d89eeea-8ae2-422f-97ff-0afefc5eee17"}

Considering diverse praxis functions, our study revealed a high prevalence of apraxia: 67% of the patients showed apraxic deficits in at least one apraxia test, and about half of the patients even suffered from moderate to severe apraxia. This finding suggests that apraxia is common already in the mild (to moderate) stages of AD, as most of the current patients presented with MCI or mild dementia. In line with previous reports [25], apraxia severity was related to the severity of general cognitive impairment.\nAs hypothesised, patients with Alzheimer's pathology showed greater impairment in imitating finger configurations compared to hand positions, independent of general cognitive deficits. This finding is consistent with previous neuropsychological studies in stroke patients with apraxia, reporting dissociations between the imitation of hand and\nfinger gestures [26, 27], suggesting different underlying cognitive processes. It has been proposed that imitating hand gestures primarily relies on the processing of spatial relationships between different body parts. In contrast, imitating finger gestures puts higher demands on visuo-spatial control for perceptual discrimination between relatively uniform elements of the body (i.e. fingers) [19, 28]. In line with this, deficits in imitating finger gestures were associated with visuo-constructive deficits in a previous study of patients with dementia [29]. Moreover, poorer performance when imitating finger configurations (compared to hand positions) has often been found in patients with right hemisphere stroke [30], probably due to deficits in visuo-spatial processing [31-33].", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/97", "#/texts/98", "#/texts/100"], "page_nos": [1], "uuid": "1d862da2-e872-4995-a381-ac4bb1e9b762"}

In contrast, the difference in imitation performance between complex and single finger movements was less pronounced and no longer statistically significant when controlling for general cognitive impairment. Thus, complex hand movements (as opposed to single hand movements) showed enhanced sensitivity in detecting imitation deficits in patients with Alzheimer's pathology. The results complement previous studies, which showed marked difficulties in imitating spatially complex (bimanual) or sequential movements in patients with AD [29, 34].\nFinally, our study showed that praxis performance, but not age or years of education, predicted general cognitive impairment in patients with biomarker-verified Alzheimer's pathology. A regression model with age and educational years explained only 2% of the variance in general cognitive deficits. Adding apraxia scores improved the model to about 60% explained variance, which represented a statistically significant increase in predictive power. The finding that performance in the KAS subtest of pantomiming object use and the DATE subtest for limb apraxia (involving imitation of hand and finger gestures and pantomime of object use) were independent predictors of general cognitive functioning supports and extends the relevance of limb apraxia as a marker of cognitive impairment in patients with Alzheimer's pathology, as implicated by several previous studies in patients with mild-to-moderate AD [10, 11, 35]. It further demonstrates that deficits in pantomiming object use are a significant predictor of general cognitive impairment. It has been proposed that several cognitive mechanisms underlie the pantomime of object use, including semantic knowledge about tool function, sensorimotor knowledge about tool manipulation, and mechanical knowledge for technical reasoning about object use [36]. Both semantic knowledge", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/101", "#/texts/102"], "page_nos": [1], "uuid": "ee7832d7-62f4-4923-958f-b324b5a63c80"}

Consistent with this, grey matter atrophy in the middle temporal gyrus and angular gyrus has been found to be associated with deficits in pantomiming object use in the early stages of AD [23]. Moreover, tau aggregation in temporal, parietal, and occipital regions has recently been associated with apraxic deficits in patients with biomarker-confirmed diagnosis of AD [39]. Accordingly, our data suggest that impaired praxis performance may serve not only as a predictor of general cognitive impairment but also as an (early) behavioural marker of Alzheimer's pathology.\nIn conclusion, the present study established that in patients with biomarker-verified Alzheimer's pathology apraxic deficits are common even at mild (to moderate) disease stages and show distinct patterns in different praxis domains. The apraxic deficits explained variance in the patients' general cognitive impairment, emphasising the relevance of apraxia in AD. Our results warrant further investigation into the role of apraxia as a potential behavioural marker of Alzheimer's pathology at early stages of AD.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https://doi.org/10.1007/s00415-025-13401-9.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/105", "#/texts/106", "#/texts/107"], "page_nos": [1], "uuid": "0bb5bd39-ab32-4504-b2be-2e034e718c20"}
