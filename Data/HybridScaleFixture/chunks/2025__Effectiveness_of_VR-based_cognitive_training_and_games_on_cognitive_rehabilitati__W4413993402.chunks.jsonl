Given the limited efficacy of pharmacological interventions and the escalating global burden of aging populations, effective non-pharmacological strategies are urgently needed. Virtual Reality (VR), offering immersive and interactive environments, shows promise for cognitive rehabilitation in MCI, but evidence regarding its efficacy remains inconsistent due to heterogeneity in intervention types (training vs. gaming) and technical parameters, particularly immersion level.\nObjective:\nThis systematic review and meta-analysis synthesized evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the efficacy of VR-based cognitive training and gaming interventions on cognitive function in older adults with MCI and to investigate the moderating role of immersion level.\nMethods:\nWe systematically searched four electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Scopus) from inception to July 20, 2025, for RCTs investigating VR interventions (cognitive training or games) in individuals aged \u2265 55 years diagnosed with MCI. Two independent reviewers performed study selection, data extraction (including intervention characteristics, implementation details, and behavior change techniques), and risk-of-bias assessment using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool (RevMan 5.4.1). Standardized mean differences ((Hedges's g) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were pooled using random-effects models in Stata 18.0. Heterogeneity was quantified using I\u00b2. Publication bias was assessed via funnel plots and Egger's test. Pre-specified meta-regression explored immersion level as a potential moderator.\nResults:\nOf the 1,411 articles retrieved in total, 11 studies were included in the analysis. VR demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in the efficacy of cognitive rehabilitation among patients with MCI (Hedges's g = 0.6, 95% CI: 0.29 to 0.90, p\nConclusions:", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/158", "#/texts/159", "#/texts/160", "#/texts/161", "#/texts/162", "#/texts/163", "#/texts/164", "#/texts/165", "#/texts/166"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "167d4dda-dcbf-477c-b5e8-db9749178f24"}

Critical to these outcomes is VR immersion level, highlighting the need to optimize sensory integration (e.g., multi-modal feedback) while balancing individual tolerance. Moderate heterogeneity across studies underscores the importance of standardized protocols for intervention design and immersion assessment. These findings support VR as a valuable non-pharmacological tool for MCI cognitive rehabilitation, with future research needed to refine personalized approaches and enhance generalizability.\n\nCurrent Preprint Settings\nEffectiveness of VR-based cognitive training and games on cognitive rehabilitation in patients with MCI\uff1aA Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis\nCitation\nPlease cite as:\nYuan P, Peng D, Chen J, Liu B, Lu C\nEffectiveness of VR-based cognitive training and games on cognitive rehabilitation in patients with MCI\uff1aA Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis\nJMIR Preprints. 28/08/2025:82876\nDOI:\n10.2196/preprints.82876\nURL:\nhttps://preprints.jmir.org/preprint/82876\nDownload PDF\nRequest queued.
