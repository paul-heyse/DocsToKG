While PD-MCI may revert to normal cognition, it remains a critical risk factor for PDD, with up to 85% of patients progressing within 20 years (\n1\n). PDD severely impacts patients' quality of life and increases caregiver burden, underscoring the urgency of early intervention (\n2\n). Current pharmacological options for PD-MCI are limited and may exacerbate adverse effects; however, non-pharmacological interventions offer a safer alternative by mitigating drug-related risks and potentially delaying PDD onset (\n3\n).

Instead, evidence was synthesized thematically, with quality assessed using AGREE II and JBI tools to ensure rigor. In addition, differences in intervention design (e.g., duration and frequency) and cultural adaptation (e.g., the use of Tai Chi in Chinese studies) led to heterogeneity. We addressed this issue by dividing the evidence into six themes and prioritizing high-quality guidelines (AFREE II \u2265 60%) and randomized controlled trials. A total of 22 relevant pieces of evidence were extracted from the 13 included studies on PD-MCI patients.

However, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is insidious, often occurring early in the disease or even prior to motor symptoms, making it difficult to detect. If the disease progresses to PDD, it severely impacts patients' ability to live independently and reduces their quality of life, while also increasing the caregiver burden. Evidence shows that PD-MCI is a major independent risk factor for progression to PDD. Diagnosis of PD-MCI can be made based on objective neuropsychological tests and clinical reports. Brief assessment methods can provide a preliminary evaluation of overall cognitive function; however, institutions with sufficient resources should use specific assessment scales to evaluate cognitive domain impairment and develop targeted interventions. Furthermore, studies have shown that PD patients with cognitive impairment often have co-occurring depression. Therefore, it is recommended to include depression screening in cognitive assessments to exclude risk factors and enable early intervention (\n10\n). Recent studies have suggested that objective physiological indicators, such as cerebrospinal fluid analysis, magnetic resonance imaging, and EEG, may be useful for diagnosing PD-MCI.

Cognitive interventions include cognitive training, cognitive rehabilitation, and cognitive stimulation. Among them, cognitive training, which includes traditional paper-based methods, computer-based training, and virtual reality-based training, is recommended for PD-MCI patients. Computer-based cognitive training is considered especially effective, as it integrates visual, auditory, and other sensory stimuli, which studies have shown improve focus and training outcomes (\n12\n). With the rise of big data and mobile health, cognitive training is likely to shift gradually from hospital-based to home-based rehabilitation. Cognitive training programs suitable for the elderly should be developed with the help of smartphones and other mobile devices. Additionally, big data should be used for dynamic evaluation and feedback to enhance the sustained effectiveness of cognitive intervention. Additionally, personalized cognitive training programs should be tailored to the specific symptoms of PD-MCI patients. These programs should offer diverse forms of training, promote social interaction, and ensure appropriate intensity and duration.

Comorbidities such as sleep disorders, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia have also been shown to significantly accelerate cognitive deterioration (\n14\n,\n15\n). Targeting these modifiable risk factors, health education and lifestyle interventions have emerged as pivotal strategies to delay the progression of PD-MCI:(1) Stratified Health Education: Tailored to patients' cognitive levels and educational backgrounds, we use visual teaching tools (infographics/instructional videos) for disease education, emphasizing the clinical manifestations of PD-MCI, modifiable risk factors, and the potential progression to PDD. Behavioral interventions (smoking cessation, alcohol restriction, and sleep regulation) have demonstrated efficacy in decelerating cognitive decline (\n16\n). (2) Structured Exercise: Physical exercise exerts neuroprotective effects by promoting neuronal proliferation and enhancing cerebral function, thereby improving cognitive performance in PD patients (\n17\n). Current evidence-based exercise modalities for PD-MCI include Tai Chi, aerobic training, tango dancing, and recumbent cycling. While Tai Chi-originating from China-has demonstrated cognitive benefits across diverse populations (e.g., Spain, France, and South Korea) in dementia rehabilitation (\n18\n-\n20\n), most non-Chinese trials remain limited in scale. Large-scale multinational randomized controlled trials are warranted to standardize protocols and validate outcomes across heterogeneous healthcare systems. As summarized in\nTable 6\n, exercise frequency guidelines for cognitive training, aerobic exercise, and endurance training are aligned with current clinical recommendations.(3) Precision Nutrition Intervention: Dietary factors play a critical role in PD pathogenesis and management. Both Mediterranean diets and low-carbohydrate diets have shown significant improvements in executive function and verbal fluency (\n21\n,\n22\n). We recommend increased dietary fiber intake to prevent constipation and vitamin D supplementation (400-800 IU/day). Vitamin D deficiency correlates with accelerated cognitive decline, while its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties may mitigate dementia risk (\n23", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/341", "#/texts/342", "#/texts/343", "#/texts/344", "#/texts/345", "#/texts/346", "#/texts/347", "#/texts/348", "#/texts/349", "#/texts/350", "#/texts/351", "#/texts/352", "#/texts/353", "#/texts/354", "#/texts/355", "#/texts/356", "#/texts/357", "#/texts/358", "#/texts/359", "#/texts/360", "#/texts/361", "#/texts/362"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "1f366050-cc50-47c5-85e0-d0ca848a143f"}

(4) Synergistic Effects: Multimodal interventions exhibit synergistic benefits for cognitive enhancement. Health education establishes a cognitive framework for disease understanding, exercise enhances cerebral function through neuroprotective mechanisms, and precision nutrition delays decline through metabolic modulation. Collectively, multidimensional lifestyle interventions regulate neuroplasticity and metabolic homeostasis, offering a safe and effective non-pharmacological approach for PD-MCI management.\nTable 6\nTable 6\n.

Monotherapy approaches often fail to address these multifaceted needs, necessitating personalized intervention plans tailored to individual clinical profiles (\n24\n). Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a non-invasive neuromodulation technique, has been investigated for addressing cognitive deficits in PD. In PD patients, rTMS protocols demonstrate therapeutic potential not only for motor symptom improvement but also for alleviating non-motor symptoms, including depression and cognitive dysfunction (\n24\n). Dual-task training, which requires simultaneous performance of two distinct tasks, enhances attentional control, processing speed, and cognitive flexibility. For PD patients, this approach can be adapted to functional scenarios such as ambulation, stair negotiation, and dressing. Ecologically relevant activities-including simulated driving and shopping tasks-not only improve cognitive performance but also enhance gait stability, balance control, and self-efficacy during daily activities, thereby effectively reducing fall risk (\n25\n). Future research should focus on developing precision intervention frameworks that integrate individualized cognitive profiles, neurophysiological biomarkers, and real-world functional demands to optimize therapeutic synergy in PD-MCI management.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/363", "#/texts/364", "#/texts/365", "#/texts/366", "#/texts/368", "#/texts/369", "#/texts/370", "#/texts/371", "#/texts/372", "#/texts/373", "#/texts/374"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "f45a2d8a-3136-46e0-9527-bc6050f1510e"}

Although some studies suggest that repeated rTMS may benefit cognitive function in PD patients, its effects remain unclear. Therapeutic targets and parameters are inconsistent, and further clinical studies are needed for confirmation. While Chinese studies contributed valuable insights (e.g., Tai Chi and transcranial needle stimulation), regional differences must be acknowledged. China's healthcare system often integrates traditional practices into rehabilitation, which may not be directly applicable in Western settings. Additionally, cultural acceptance of home-based training and family-led care differs from individual-centric models elsewhere. Demographic factors (e.g., older age at diagnosis in Chinese cohorts) may also influence outcomes. Future multinational trials are needed to validate these interventions across diverse populations. While cognitive scores remain primary endpoints, patient-reported outcomes (e.g., daily functioning) are equally vital. Health education improved self-management, yet no trials have assessed long-term social participation. Future studies should adopt holistic metrics such as the WHOQOL-BREF. Based on the aforementioned research findings, a dual-track model of \"disciplinary collaboration + intelligent monitoring\" can be established in the future. On one hand, this involves developing multidisciplinary teams in neurology, rehabilitation, nutrition, and psychology to formulate comprehensive plans that include medication guidance, physical function exercises, and health education. On the other hand, it strengthens family and community support by using smart bracelets, APPs, and other devices to monitor patients' activities and cognitive states in real-time, providing remote training guidance, and regularly revising the plan through follow-up visits. This integrated management system of \"hospital-community-family\" is expected to break through the time and space limitations of traditional interventions, achieving precise and continuous rehabilitation for PD-MCI patients.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/376"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "9c34f50d-282e-457d-a9b7-aa7d5a5a89a1"}
