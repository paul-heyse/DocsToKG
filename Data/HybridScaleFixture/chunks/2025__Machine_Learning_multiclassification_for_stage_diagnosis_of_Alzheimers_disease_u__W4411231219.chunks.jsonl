There is loss of connection between the neurons of the brain. Hippocampus is the likely pace where the problem seems to start. But as the neurons die, subsequently other brain parts also get affected. This leads to problems like short-term memory loss in the initial stages. Then happens progressive problems with loss of short-term memory initially. Next, a decline happens in other cognitive faculties followed by behavioural issues. Broadly 3 stages are defined for the progression of this disease. They are CN, MCI and AD. \"MCI is attractive because it represents a transitional state between normal aging and dementia\" [\n1\n]. Vast majority of people of age 65 years or above are generally prone to AD [\n2\n]. As expectancy of life of people is increasing, AD patient count is also increasing all over the world.\nNo major cure of AD is established till date [\n3\n]. There is tremendous progress in analysis of brain, brain functions, its changes in MCI and AD stages with the clinical applications of MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) and PET (positron emission tomography) have led to tremendous development in brain analysis, understanding brain function and its changes in MCI and AD stages [\n4\n,\n5\n].", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/72", "#/texts/73", "#/texts/74", "#/texts/75", "#/texts/76", "#/texts/77", "#/texts/78", "#/texts/79", "#/texts/80", "#/texts/81", "#/texts/82", "#/texts/83"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "595ac6e1-cec0-4365-bb7d-8a33a9c59885"}

Mitochondrial dysfunction, characterized by the impairment of mitochondrial function and consequent reduction in cellular energy production, is increasingly recognized as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of Alzheimer's Disease [\n6\n]. Genetic analysis can predict AD risk in an individual much earlier than clinical symptoms of AD appear. Genetic factors play a major role in 80% AD cases [\n7\n]. 'Genome Wide Association Studies' (GWAS) is able to discover some AD candidate genes. However, GWAS have majorly failed to produce AD candidate genes with reliability. Thousands of genes are considered as potential AD risk factors [\n8\n,\n9\n]. But GWAS only discovers genes that are associated with some phenotypes and fail to address the genes functionality causing AD [\n10\n]. Gene expression provides the opportunity to biochemical pathway analysis, regulatory mechanisms and cellular functions to find the key AD and MCI genes. Some research utilised gene expression values from brain tissues from biopsy or autopsy-based samples [\n11\n,\n12\n]. However, various difficulties are involved with such autopsy samples for analysis. But brain dynamics, changes are also expressed in blood and large portion of gene expression in body is also found in PBMCs (Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells) [\n13\n]. Amyloid precursor protein expression, oxidative damage in RNA and DNA of AD brain tissue are reflected in peripheral blood and as well [\n14\n]. So, blood gene expression is getting attention as an appropriate method and diagnose AD and MCI [\n15\n,\n16\n].\nWith availability of biomarker datasets in public space, Machine learning (ML) is becoming a major support in diagnosis of a disease and the stage. ML is now widely used in disease diagnosis with increasing availability of AD datasets.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/84", "#/texts/85", "#/texts/86", "#/texts/87", "#/texts/88", "#/texts/89", "#/texts/90", "#/texts/91", "#/texts/92", "#/texts/93", "#/texts/94", "#/texts/95", "#/texts/96", "#/texts/97", "#/texts/98", "#/texts/99", "#/texts/100", "#/texts/101", "#/texts/102", "#/texts/103", "#/texts/104", "#/texts/105", "#/texts/106", "#/texts/107"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "60a7a4f5-c6ab-4bab-b3fa-3fc74367dee8"}

Primary issues in the earlier research were lack of sufficient and authentic data samples and less accuracy in achieving performance [\n17\n]. Some AD research is done with gene expression data from human brain with good accuracy achieved. Our research focus is on AD stage diagnosis with gene expression data in a non-invasive way where gene expression samples from human blood suits our research focus. So we restricted our existing literature study to AD diagnosis with gene expression. Some important AD research with blood genome expression data has been already done using ML techniques [\n11\n,\n15\n,\n16\n,\n18\n,\n19\n,\n20\n,\n21\n]. We have reviewed earlier research papers on use of blood gene expression data for Alzheimer disease diagnosis and listed some recent studies [2017-2024] in Table\n12\nfor identification of AD from gene expression data. NCBI and ADNI datasets have been extensively employed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis research, utilizing statistical approaches, machine learning techniques, and deep neural networks. Considerable research on AD has been conducted using genome expression data and machine learning methodologies. Huang et al. [\n22\n] introduced an SVM-based technique for classifying AD genes from human brain gene network data and whole-genome gene expression. This method achieved 84.56% accuracy and 94% ROC in categorizing AD candidate genes, offering an alternative approach to identifying AD-associated genes from over 20,000 genes on a genome-wide scale.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/108", "#/texts/109", "#/texts/110", "#/texts/111", "#/texts/112", "#/texts/113", "#/texts/114", "#/texts/115", "#/texts/116", "#/texts/117", "#/texts/118", "#/texts/119", "#/texts/120", "#/texts/121", "#/texts/122", "#/texts/123", "#/texts/124", "#/texts/125", "#/texts/126", "#/texts/127", "#/texts/128"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "e4afa5f4-a022-4407-a0b8-783a14710b8c"}

They developed ML models using LR, L1-LR, SVM, RF, and DNN based on AD-related gene expression data. The study yielded the highest average AUC values of 0.657 for ADNI, 0.874 for ANMI, and 0.804 for ANM2 dataset with fivefold cross-validation. These outcomes indicate that blood sample gene expression data can effectively predict AD stages. However, the significant data imbalance in ADNI, where the minority dementia sample size was considerably smaller than the other two categories, resulted in a low AUC score. Moreover, despite the datasets containing three labels, including the MCI stage, multiclassification was not explored. Park et al. [\n20\n] developed a DL-based model for AD classification using integrated large-scale DNA methylation and gene expression data to create multi-omics datasets. Their model attained an accuracy of 0.823, outperforming single omics datasets.

Enhancing genomic results with clinical data is crucial because it allows for a more comprehensive understanding of a patient's health condition by combining genetic information with their medical history, symptoms, and other relevant clinical factors, leading to more accurate diagnoses. Linking genomic data with relevant clinical information from EHRs through standardized data formats and identifiers facilitates joint analysis. AlMansoori et al. [\n23\n] created a multimodal machine learning method to differentiate between CN and MCI/AD cases. By combining gene expression profiles, clinical data, and SNP data using MI feature selection from 623 ADNI participants, they achieved an AUC performance of 0.95 in binary classification. However, when using gene expression data alone, the AUC performance decreased to 0.65. It is observed that, performance output of some of the earlier research is promising with AUC score around 80% when balanced dataset GEO datasets are used for model training/test. However, results are not promising when train and test dataset is ADNI. The score is far less when compared with other results. Primary reason for this low score is that multiple challenges are associated with ADNI gene expression data. ADNI gene expression data is of 'HDLSS' in nature [\n24\n]. It has 49,386 gene probes/gene transcripts (or features), has only 744 samples and is imbalanced as well as reflected in Table\n1\n. So, when the model is constructed and validated with same ADNI data, performance is low. The authors have worked with novel feature selection and modelling approach, however they have ignored the fact that low sample size and inherent data imbalance impact the learning of the model.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/134", "#/texts/135", "#/texts/136", "#/texts/137", "#/texts/138", "#/texts/139", "#/texts/140"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "6c2a415d-b5b9-43b1-a98b-b86f99edbd90"}

In our experiment, we treated the ADNI and the two NCBI datasets separately. All three datasets underwent a two-phase feature reduction process separately. Initially, features with minimal weight were removed using the GBX feature ranking method. The remaining features were further reduced with the SFBS algorithm. The final datasets, with reduced features, were analysed separately using classifiers and the SHAP tool.

The Gene expression profiling data from ADNI is collected from blood samples of 744 ADNI participants. The samples were collected in different ADNI phases, and the Affymetrix Human Genome (HG) U219 Array was used for expression profiling. The samples were passed through different QC processes and ultimately samples from 744 participants were chosen for further analysis. Each sample from these 744 participants consists of total 49,386 probe sets. Each sample from GSE6030 and GSE6031 consists of 38,323 and 32,049 number of gene transcripts respectively.\nObtaining stage diagnosis information for ADNI dataset participants proved difficult due to its limited availability. To derive this information, researchers utilized collection phase/date and patient ID data common to both study/clinical records and gene expression profiles. It's important to note that the subjects involved in genome expression profiling represent a subset of the overall study/clinical data participants.\nAs shown in Table\n2\n, the other two datasets GSE3060 (AddneuroMed Cohort batch 1), and GSE3061 (AddneuroMed Cohort batch 2) were obtained using different Illumina expression beadchip platforms. GSE3060 utilized the 'Illumina HumanHT-12 V3.0 expression beadchip', while GSE3061 employed the 'Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 expression beadchip'. The GSE3060 data is collected from 329 participants while GSE3061 is collected from 388 participants. We have not used one participant's sample from GSE3061 for unknown data. So, total NCBI samples from two datasets considered in our research is 716.\nBoth NCBI datasets have similar micro array settings. We noticed some difference in data statistics as shown in Table\n3\n.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/144", "#/texts/145", "#/texts/146", "#/texts/147", "#/texts/148", "#/texts/149", "#/texts/150", "#/texts/151", "#/texts/152", "#/texts/153", "#/texts/154", "#/texts/155"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "3ff1b2cc-89e5-4ac8-bf52-e5728c89bde8"}

So, we directly applied pre-processing/cleaning on the gene expression dataset. Normalization/scaling of data was done using 'MinMax' scaler. Min-Max scaling, a prevalent pre-processing technique in gene expression analysis, is particularly utilized when preparing data for machine learning models. This method can enhance both the performance and interpretability of the models [\n27\n]. After pre-processing, there were 48,158 gene transcripts or features for ADNI. There are 38,323 and 32,049 gene transcripts in NCBI gene expression datasets GSE63060 and GSE63060 respectively. This is 'curse of dimensionality' because of very high dimension [\n28\n]. It results in very high overfitting. Again, order of 30,000-50,000 leads to computational inefficiency as well. Some earlier research applied feature selection techniques like VAE (Variational Auto Encoder), LASSO, RFE (recursive feature elimination) [\n11\n,\n19\n]. For auto encoder techniques, we need to provide number of features to be minimized and selected features are in encoded representation. The VAE generates feature representations in a latent form, which cannot be directly mapped back to the original features. Consequently, the original feature names, such as the names of genes in this study, are not retained. While the LASSO method is effective for high-dimensional data, it tends to arbitrarily select one among correlated features and may not perform optimally when numerous relevant features are present.

Sequential floating backward selection (SFBS) starts with all features, iteratively removes the worst-performing feature, and then re-evaluates the remaining features, potentially adding back a previously removed feature if it improves performance. This \"floating\" aspect, where features can be added or removed, makes it potentially superior to methods like LASSO or VAE, which are less flexible in their feature selection process. So, it is a superior feature selection technique that has the potential to identify a more optimal subset of features compared to the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), particularly when addressing complex interrelationships among features. Nevertheless, it is computationally intensive, especially when applied to high-dimensional data like gene expression. XGBoost is capable of calculating feature importance using various metrics, such as gain, weight, and cover. It is highly scalable and efficient, designed to manage large datasets comprising millions or even billions of instances and features. XGBoost enables the rapid and efficient selection of a specific number of features from a comprehensive feature set, such as gene expression data, by employing the feature score. This particular set of features can be applied to SFBS, potentially yielding a more optimal subset of features that addresses complex interrelationships. Subsequently, we devise an approach for selecting crucial features that involve a two-phase process. Initially, we employ the XGBoost algorithm to compute feature scores for each attribute and rank the gene transcripts accordingly. Subsequently, we apply the SFBS algorithm to the highest-ranked gene transcripts. This dual-step method for feature selection proves more effective than alternative techniques. SFBS considers all the features combinations to get best classification score and chooses the best combination of features in an iterative way. The application of SFBS resulted in the selection of 95 features or transcript genes from the top 300 ranked transcripts identified by XGBoost in the context of ADNI gene transcripts, as illustrated in Fig.\n1\n. For NCBI datasets GSE3060 and GSE3061, the number of features selected by the SFBS are 69 and 84 out of 500 top ranked genes as shown Fig.\n3\n.\nFig. 1", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/167", "#/texts/168", "#/texts/169", "#/texts/170", "#/texts/171", "#/texts/172"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "c99d35b3-5063-4188-b9a3-23adf5d80462"}

This vector serves as an informative representation for subsequent analysis and classification [\n30\n]. We focus on two modalities of ADNI data: blood gene expression profile and clinical study datasets available on the Laboratory of Neuro Imaging (LONI) website. The 744 ADNI participants contributing to gene expression samples constitute a subset of the 2400 participants contributing to clinical study samples. 95 identified genes of ADNI gene expression data and 8 biomarkers (APOE4, PTMARRY, FDG, Hippocampus, WholeBrain, mPACCdigit, LDELTOTAL, CDRSB) of clinical study data are integrated by applying concatenation technique. The selection of eight clinical biomarkers from a total of 116 biomarkers in the ADNI clinical dataset was accomplished using the 'sequential floating backward selection' (SBSF) feature reduction technique. Prior to the application of the SBSF technique, data cleaning procedures were implemented. For non-target attributes, missing values were addressed by substituting the average value for numerical data and the 'maximum occurring value' for categorical data. In contrast, for target or label attributes, imputing null values was deemed risky, leading to the exclusion of rows with null labels. Following data cleaning and imputation, the data was normalized.\nThe dataset integration process occurs in two stages. Initially, common participants from the ADNI gene expression profile and clinical study data collection initiative were identified. Subsequently, records of these common participants were selected from the datasets. Participants contributing gene expressions are included in the clinical study data participants. Consequently, 744 records from each dataset were selected.\nfigure a\nIn the second step, a column-wise integration of the two datasets is performed, resulting in the integrated data.

However, ADNI and NCBI gene expression data are collected from different micro array settings. They follow different gene naming standard. Numerous essential genes are eliminated during the selection of common genes common genes across ADNI and two NCBI datasets, thereby affecting the overall quality of the model. Therefore, this study will primarily utilize internal validation methods, eschewing external validation across the dataset.\nGiven that both NCBI datasets were collected from similar micro array settings with common gene naming standard followed, we combined the samples, resulting a total of 716 samples to construct a more generalizable model that can be independently validated with NCBI GSE3060 and GSE3061 specific test data.\nGenomic dataset is characterized by high-dimensionality, low sample size (HDLSS), and imbalanced nature. A significant class imbalance in the samples particularly in the ADNI dataset is observed in the samples. The minority class is hard to predict as there are fewer samples and so, there is less learning opportunity than that of majority samples. Most of the learning methods are biased towards the majority class, so most of the minority samples are not modelled well [\n31\n]. Though intense work happened to resolve issues with imbalanced learning, still there are many short comings [\n32\n]. No research have been done yet on classification of imbalanced gene expression data. The main problem of imbalanced classification is that because of fewer samples of minority category, the model cannot properly learn decision boundary [\n33\n]. The research methodology employed in this study involved the creation of models using two contrasting strategies: one that specifically tackled the issue of imbalanced datasets, while the other disregarded such considerations.

While binary classification can help identify specific disease stage like dementia/AD out of the three stages from the data, multiclassification helps identify all the stages of the disease. Many of the prior research used binary classification technique to diagnose dementia/AD from gene expression data considering MCI and CN together as belonging to non-dementia/AD category. Previous research has identified and differentiated disease stages such as CN versus AD, CN versus MCI, and MCI versus AD through binary classification. However, this approach necessitates three separate classifications, resulting in reduced data due to the exclusion of specific categories. Many researchers have favoured this binary classification due to its simplicity compared to multiclass classification. In contrast to binary classification, multiclass classification is resource-intensive and complex, particularly when the dataset is significantly imbalanced, leading to a notable decline in classification performance. Multiclass classification, which entails managing multiple categories, is inherently versatile. However, it requires the implementation of effective techniques to address class imbalance and the utilization of performance evaluation metrics such as the F1 score and AUC, rather than relying on accuracy. Given that Alzheimer's disease encompasses multiple stages, as reflected in blood gene expression biomarker data, and the objective is to diagnose these stages, a multiclassification technique has been employed.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/201"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "fba1c182-87b8-4fba-b4c1-045f603a563d"}

Cost-sensitive learning, ensemble learning, data weighting, resampling techniques are some of the methods used in designing classifiers from imbalanced data. However, given the limited sample size and unbalanced nature of the gene expression data, we opted for a data resampling based augmentation strategy. Compared with weighted, ensemble learning and cost-sensitive learning, oversampling/data augmentation is a better approach while dealing with severely imbalanced dataset. Oversampling/data augmentation is often a more effective and direct approach for severely imbalanced datasets, as it directly addresses the lack of minority class samples [\n29\n]. Application of oversampling for obtaining a more balanced dataset is an effective approach. Minority sample data is duplicated before fitting the model. One of the most popular method is 'Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique', or SMOTE for short [\n34\n]. ADASYN (Adaptive Synthetic Sampling) is another method employed to tackle the issue of unbalanced datasets in machine learning, enhancing the classification accuracy for minority classes. The key distinction between ADASYN and SMOTE lies in their approach to generating synthetic samples. ADASYN creates these samples adaptively, taking into account the density distribution of minority class instances. In contrast, SMOTE produces synthetic samples by interpolating between existing minority class examples. It is found that ADASYN and SMOTE produce almost similar performance. SpringerOpen showed that SVM models performed best with ADASYN, achieving 99.67% accuracy, followed by SMOTE at 99.57% and Borderline SMOTE at 99.59% [\n35\n]. SMOTE generally performs better when the dataset has a high degree of imbalance, while ADASYN is better suited for datasets with a moderate imbalance or where the minority class is clustered tightly [\n36\n]. In research with imbalanced Ecoli datasets, SMOTE deemed to perform better than ADASYN, with a higher increase in performance [\n36", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/203", "#/texts/204", "#/texts/205", "#/texts/206", "#/texts/207", "#/texts/208", "#/texts/209", "#/texts/210", "#/texts/211", "#/texts/212", "#/texts/213", "#/texts/214"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "54d5473c-cbc9-4f4b-b034-50993e403f96"}

SMOTE is better than ADASYN on the basis of performance matrices such as recall, precision, F1 score in prior research and SMOTE is simple to use [\n36\n]. So, we opted for SMOTE.\nFig. 4\nThere are two popular SMOTE variants-'Tomek Links' and 'Boderline SMOTE'. Tomek Links is an under-sampling technique that removes instances from the majority class that are close to the minority class, while Borderline SMOTE is an oversampling technique where misclassified minority samples are selected for oversampling instead of blind oversampling. Random oversampling increases the likelihood of overfitting occurrence as it makes exact minority class sample copies [\n31\n]. To address this problem of overfitting, only selected samples needs to be oversampled-artificially creating additional samples of the minority class at border line can effectively augment the data. Instances that are misclassified are often ambiguous and situated near the decision boundary, where class membership may overlap. This adaptation of SMOTE is termed Borderline-SMOTE, as proposed by Han et al. in their 2005 paper titled \"Borderline-SMOTE\" [\n37\n]. Borderline-SMOTE involves selecting misclassified instances of the minority class, such as those identified by a k-nearest neighbour classification model, and generating synthetic samples that are challenging to classify. Borderline Oversampling extends SMOTE by fitting a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to the dataset and utilizing the decision boundary, as defined by the support vectors, as the basis for generating synthetic examples. This approach is predicated on the notion that the decision boundary is the region where additional minority examples are necessary. The samples at border line and the nearby ones tend to be misclassified more than the ones that are far from borderline, and so more important for classification. Due to the limited sample size of the gene expression data and to reduce risk of overfitting, the 'Borderline SMOTE' technique was selected.\nWe utilized the SMOTE-based data augmentation technique to construct all models.

The models that used SMOTE were specifically designed to address imbalanced class distributions, while the non-SMOTE models did not account for this issue. We are using k-fold cross validation technique. Cross-validation is a data resampling methodology utilized to evaluate the generalization capability of predictive models and to mitigate overfitting [\n40\n,\n41\n]. \"In k-fold cross-validation, the available learning set is partitioned into k disjoint subsets of approximately equal size. Here, fold refers to the number of resulting subsets. This partitioning is performed by randomly sampling cases from the learning set without replacement. The model is trained using k\u2009\u2212\u20091 subsets, which, together, represent the training set. Then, the model is applied to the remaining subset, which is denoted as the validation set, and the performance is measured. This procedure is repeated until each of the k subsets has served as validation set\" [\n40\n]. The number of training samples is augmented by the SMOTE-based minority oversampling method where minority sample size is increased, as outlined in the preceding section. The subsequent tables present the AUC and F1 performance scores obtained from fivefold cross-validation for each model instance constructed from both biomarker categories. Figure\n5\nillustrates the SMOTE-based model construction process. The diagram demonstrates that the training data undergoes an 'oversample' step, indicating that oversampling is applied exclusively to the training dataset, not on the validation dataset. Reason is that it is necessary to do evaluation of the model with a dataset that represents the problem domain. Model evaluation with a dataset with deleted or synthesized examples would most likely provide an optimistic performance estimation [\n33\n]. In models that do not utilize SMOTE, the 'oversample' component is absent.\nFig. 5", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/232", "#/texts/233", "#/texts/234", "#/texts/235", "#/texts/236", "#/texts/237", "#/texts/238", "#/texts/239", "#/texts/240", "#/texts/241", "#/texts/242", "#/texts/243"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "07ed97d7-ef8e-49eb-ae99-6c90ecf04857"}

Our approach to model development differs from that used with ADNI data. In our model construction process, we combined the training datasets from both ANM1 and ANM2 data sets, then evaluated the resulting model separately with the test data from ANM1 and ANM2. Since ANM1 and ANM2 data were collected from similar microarray technical settings, the transcripts follow same gene transcript naming and data standardization, the datasets could be integrated. Integrating ANM1and ANM2 datasets, as illustrated in Fig.\n6\nhelped increase sample size and that way brought variation and diversity in the data.\nFig. 6\nNevertheless, the overall sample size was considered inadequate when using fivefold or tenfold cross-validation to generate sufficient combinations of training and testing data. So, we followed resampling based approach in place of k-fold cross validation. By employing a resampling technique, we randomly allocate 70% of the dataset for training purposes and 30% for testing in each iteration. This ensures model variations and different test data for better analysis.\nTrain and test strategies of NCBI data based models are elaborated through algorithmic steps in Fig.\n7\n. In each resampling, 70% of samples from GSE3060 and GSE3061 are integrated based on common features and then trained for model construction.

The F1 score represents the harmonic mean of precision and recall, serving as a metric that effectively balances both. Within the domains of machine learning and information retrieval, precision quantifies the accuracy of positive predictions, whereas recall assesses the model's capability to identify all relevant instances. In essence, precision emphasizes the accuracy of the model's positive predictions, while recall underscores its capacity to capture all positive cases. The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve illustrates the True Positive Rate (sensitivity) in relation to the False Positive Rate across various classification thresholds. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) quantifies the area beneath the ROC curve, thereby encapsulating the model's overall performance. Although accuracy is a commonly used metric, it is considered inadequate for assessing model performance with imbalanced datasets [\n33\n]. Consequently, we opted not to use it. When dealing with imbalanced data, researchers have utilized various metrics. Among these, the most frequently employed approach is the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis, along with the area under the ROC curve [\n42\n,\n43\n]. Other popular metrics used in imbalanced learning are based on precision and recall. F1-measure equally weights precision and recall. This variant is often used as performance metric while learning from imbalanced data [\n33\n]. For a better evaluation of the models, we have utilised cross validation and iterative resampling approach. We initially conducted several trials by temporarily adjusting the random state within the k-fold cross-validation method. Similarly, we made several trials in our iterative resampling approach. This approach was employed to control randomness, ensure the reproducibility of results, and optimize parameters, thereby facilitating the minimization of performance variations across different random states.

We employ the SHAP technique on an XGBoost algorithm-based model to determine the influence of individual features or gene transcripts on the model's output for three Alzheimer's disease (AD) stages: cognitively normal (CN), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia. We have done SHAP analysis on ADNI and combined NCBI datasets. The SHAP analysis tool, when applied to datasets, generates visual outputs (Figs.\n12\n,\n13\n,\n14\n) that facilitate the interpretation of how gene transcript expression values positively or negatively influence the results-the stage classification (CN, MCI, AD) by the classifier. The XGBoost classifier model will classify outputs as CN, AD, or MCI. We consider a gene to be associated with AD risk if its expression level (either high or low) significantly influences the model to predict AD or MCI as the output. Conversely, if the gene expression has a negative impact on AD or MCI prediction, we regard it as a suppressor gene. In cases where gene expression positively affects the model's prediction of CN, we classify it as an AD suppressor gene. However, if the impact on CN prediction is negative, we categorize the gene as an AD risk factor. Through the examination of each SHAP diagram, genes were systematically classified as either contributing to Alzheimer's disease risk or acting as suppressors, with the results compiled in Table\n15\n. In Fig.\n12\n, plot at left side shows impact of each gene towards AD stage in a native. VISG4 with red colour (high feature value) is placed at negative side of the axis with high SHAP value. That indicates high expression value of VISG4 can negatively impact AD stage output. So, VISG4 is considered as suppressor gene. VISG4 is found to be indirectly inhibiting to inflammatory diseases [\n46\n] while Alzheimer's disease is linked to inflammation in the brain. Neuroinflammation, a chronic inflammatory state in the brain, is a key factor in the progression of Alzheimer's [\n47", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/324", "#/texts/325", "#/texts/326", "#/texts/327", "#/texts/328", "#/texts/329", "#/texts/330", "#/texts/331", "#/texts/332", "#/texts/333", "#/texts/334", "#/texts/335", "#/texts/336", "#/texts/337", "#/texts/338", "#/texts/339"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "4b265c8e-5216-463f-8ebc-e2255cac72f5"}

Our study is on multiclassification and includes F1 score as performance measurement metric. Consequently, direct comparison is not feasible. With effective feature selection technique and imbalanced data handling combination, we could find 95 effective gene transcripts/probes out of 49,386 in ADNI gene expression profile and improve earlier bench mark 'ROC AUC' score from 0.657 to 0.657 of prior research of and Al Mansoori et al. and Lee et al. respectively (as shown in Table\n16\n) in CN vs. AD binary classification to mean AUC scores 0.752, 0.696, 0.631 for CN, MCI, AD respectively in multiclassification. An increment of 10% is promising. The SVM classifier demonstrates superior performance in the context of NCBI-based models, achieving mean AUC scores of 0.814, 0.683, and 0.768.\nOur research stands out from previous studies on Alzheimer's disease that analysed blood gene expression data, as we incorporated the 'F1 score' for performance evaluation in multiclassification. Our findings indicate that the ROC AUC score for multiclassification range from 70 to 80% for both ADNI and NCBI data based models, which is on par with or surpasses the performance of binary classification methods used in previous studies for identifying AD through blood gene expression data from NCBI as well ADNI datasets. The findings suggest that our feature selection methods successfully identified 95 impactful gene transcripts from ADNI blood gene expression data and 125 gene transcripts from the NCBI ANM1 and ANM2 datasets.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/353", "#/texts/354", "#/texts/355", "#/texts/356", "#/texts/357"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "4297274c-9314-4c27-8829-737f131aed5f"}

This suggests that our results are stable, the scores are on par with or surpass the performance of binary classification methods used in previous studies for identifying AD through blood gene expression data from both NCBI and ADNI databases. However, this performance score is low when compared to performance achieved through clinical and brain image data analysis. There are several reasons for this. First, gene expression data is generally of HDLSS nature when compared with clinical and image dataset. Other reason is that many pathways are involved with gene expression data. Before showing the clinical symptoms and reaching MCI and AD stages, gene expression is involved with different other pathways like protein expression/synthesis etc.\nAnalysis of the mean AUC and F1 score, confidence interval presented in Tables\n7\n,\n8\n,\n11\n,\n12\n,\n13\nand\n14\n, reveals that the models suffer in accurately classifying minority samples when compared with other two categories. Specifically, this issue is observed in the 'AD' stage identification for models based on the ADNI dataset and in the MCI stage identification for models based on the NCBI dataset. Figure\n11\nillustrates bar charts representing the AUC and F1 scores of NCBI-based models when assessed using the ANM1 and ANM2 datasets. It is apparent that the models suffer in identifying MCI stage that belongs to minority samples. This underperformance can be attributed to the limited number of minority samples of the imbalanced dataset, which restricts the model's ability to learn effectively. However, utilization of SMOTE data augmentation marginally increased classification performance of AD/Dementia category, the minority samples as compared to that of non-SMOTE based models. This is illustrated in Fig.\n15\nand ADNI mean performance, confidence interval performance scores as illustrated in Tables\n7\nand\n8\n. Results show data-augmentation using SMOTE could produce better classification especially in identification of the minority classes AD/dementia ADNI test samples respectively.\nFig. 15", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/358", "#/texts/359", "#/texts/360", "#/texts/361", "#/texts/362", "#/texts/363", "#/texts/364", "#/texts/365", "#/texts/366", "#/texts/367", "#/texts/368", "#/texts/369", "#/texts/370", "#/texts/371", "#/texts/372", "#/texts/373", "#/texts/374", "#/texts/375", "#/texts/376", "#/texts/377", "#/texts/378", "#/texts/379", "#/texts/380", "#/texts/381", "#/texts/382", "#/texts/383", "#/texts/384", "#/texts/385", "#/texts/386", "#/texts/387", "#/texts/388", "#/texts/389", "#/texts/390", "#/texts/391", "#/texts/392", "#/texts/393", "#/texts/394", "#/texts/395", "#/texts/396"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "c1e9239d-bde1-4f2f-9c75-bae6fe0bd78c"}

We collected the AUC and F1 scores for CN, MCI, and AD diagnosis for each fold of cross-validation of every classifier and compared the classifiers using the 'Wilcoxon signed-rank test'. While the mean F1 and AUC scores quantitatively assist in evaluating the superior model for distinct CN, MCI, and AD stage diagnosis performance, the 'Wilcoxon signed-rank test' results indicate the significance of the model performance differences, as evidenced by the\np\nvalues highlighted in bold in Table\n9\n. It is observed that SVM based models with non-augmented data mostly fails in classifying unbalanced ADNI data, especially the AD stage, the minority samples while GBX and DL based produce better performance. Due to their inherent ability to learn complex relationships, DL can potentially mitigate the bias towards the majority class. The weakness of the soft margin optimization problem of SVM results in the hyperplanes being skewed to the minority class [\n53\n]. XGBoost (GBX), as a boosting algorithm, is particularly well-suited for handling imbalanced datasets. Its iterative approach and capacity to adjust weights based on misclassified samples enable it to concentrate on the minority class during training. Unlike algorithms that treat all samples uniformly, XGBoost assigns greater weights to misclassified instances, especially those from the minority class, thereby enhancing its effectiveness in learning from imbalanced data. Data-augmentation-based models demonstrate superior performance compared to their counterparts in diagnosing various stages, particularly in identifying the AD stage. Additionally, DL-based classifiers are identified as the most effective.

When analysed the contributing genes of a dementia test sample using LIME, the LIME result is able to confirm. This study could find APP as one of 95 important genes from 49,000 ADNI gene transcripts. APP is already a known gene allele responsible for EOAD (Early Onset Alzheimer's Disease). However, the role of known 'AD risk' allele ApoE4 could not be established. One possible reason is that if a gene alleles is not expressed sufficiently, it cannot contribute to AD in a person.

As previously mentioned, ADNI and NCBI gene expression data are derived from distinct microarray settings and adhere to different gene naming conventions. ADNI, the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, uses a more flexible system with lowercase italicized full gene names. NCBI Gene, on the other hand, relies heavily on the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) for official gene symbols and names [\n66\n]. Consequently, numerous essential genes are excluded during the selection of genes across ADNI and the two NCBI datasets, thereby impacting the overall quality of the model. One potential explanation for the previously reported suboptimal internal validation scores of models utilizing the ADNI dataset may be attributed to this factor. In our work we took measures to ensure the retention of all essential features. Another limitation is dataset biases-demographic distributions, study design differences etc. that can impact model generalizability. Batch effects refer to systematic variations in data that arise due to technical differences in data collection or processing across different batches. In this study, an analysis was conducted by merging the NCBI datasets ANM1 and ANM2. Although the datasets ANM1 and ANM2 were derived from two similar microarray settings, they may still exhibit minor variations in data collection. The translational applicability of this work in clinical settings may be limited due to several factors that impede the successful integration of research findings into practical clinical applications. These limitations may arise from inadequate infrastructure, communication gaps between researchers and clinicians, a lack of trained personnel etc. Additionally, scientific validity, and equitable subject selection, are crucial in ensuring the responsible and effective translation of research.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/421", "#/texts/422", "#/texts/423", "#/texts/424", "#/texts/425"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "97655b97-8e56-4cf9-a53e-71074d15df62"}

We developed a multiclassification model for precise identification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) stages, including Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), the transitional phase of AD. This model utilizes blood gene expression profiles from both ADNI and NCBI participants. We addressed numerous challenges and achieved the highest known F1 score and 'ROC AUC' for multiclassification of AD stages from blood gene expression data using our two step novel feature selection and data augmentation technique. Given that data augmentation using SMOTE successfully addressed imbalance issues and improved performance, exploring generative AI techniques in future research could yield promising results. Our research indicates that the integration of gene expression data with clinical information substantially enhances diagnostic accuracy, facilitating more precise identification of disease subtypes and improving the prediction of disease progression. By elucidating the relationship between gene expression and clinical outcomes, researchers can develop more targeted and effective treatments for individual patients.\nAdditionally, we have identified 'AD risk' genes and 'AD suppressor genes' that warrant further investigation in future studies. Previous research has corroborated our findings regarding the biological significance of genes associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Further research could be conducted on the comprehensive list of genes we have identified. Our research findings demonstrate the significant potential of blood gene expression data, combined with machine learning techniques, for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease (AD) stages. This approach offers a cost-effective alternative to expensive methods like PET and MRI scans, making it more accessible to patients. The ability to detect AD at the gene expression level before symptoms appear provides valuable time for early intervention.
