However, existing research on hospitalisation risk in this population remains limited and often lacks focus on the specific causes of admission. This study aims to investigate the role of anticholinergic burden and its association with hospitalisation risk and reasons for admission among older adults with mild cognitive impairment or dementia.\nMethods:\nThis retrospective study included older adults with mild cognitive impairment or dementia attending the memory clinic between January to December 2022. Collected data from the electronic medical records includes sociodemographic information, comorbidities, cognitive and functional assessment, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and medication history. Anticholinergic burden was assessed using the Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden (ACB) score. Cox proportional hazard analysis was performed to assess the association between ACB scores and hospitalisation risk. The underlying causes of hospital admissions were compared across the different ACB score groups.\nResults:", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/64", "#/texts/65", "#/texts/66", "#/texts/67", "#/texts/68", "#/texts/69", "#/texts/70", "#/texts/71", "#/texts/72", "#/texts/73", "#/texts/74", "#/texts/75", "#/texts/76", "#/texts/77", "#/texts/78", "#/texts/79", "#/texts/80", "#/texts/81", "#/texts/82", "#/texts/83", "#/texts/84", "#/texts/85", "#/texts/86", "#/texts/87", "#/texts/88", "#/texts/89", "#/texts/90", "#/texts/91", "#/texts/92", "#/texts/93", "#/texts/94", "#/texts/95", "#/texts/96", "#/texts/97", "#/texts/98", "#/texts/99", "#/texts/100", "#/texts/101", "#/texts/102", "#/texts/103", "#/texts/104", "#/texts/105", "#/texts/106", "#/texts/107", "#/texts/108", "#/texts/109", "#/texts/110", "#/texts/111", "#/texts/112", "#/texts/113", "#/texts/114", "#/texts/115", "#/texts/116", "#/texts/117", "#/texts/118", "#/texts/119", "#/texts/120"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "790da723-1937-4ae7-99ad-65782764b092"}

Anticholinergic medication use was seen in 35.5%, with a mean ACB score of 0.8 (SD 1.3). Higher ACB scores were associated with nursing home residency, presence of neuropsychiatric symptom, poorer cognitive and physical function, and a greater number of prescribed medications compared to those with no anticholinergic burden. Older adults with ACB scores of 1- 2 had an increased risk of hospitalisation (Hazard Ratio(HR)=1.84,95% CI:1.17- 2.90) in univariate analysis, but this association was diminished after adjusting for confounders. The most common reasons for hospital admission were pneumonia (5.7%), acute kidney injury (3.8%), delirium (2.6%) and falls (2.6%). Notably, individuals hospitalised for serious adverse cardiovascular events or infected pressure ulcers had significantly higher ACB scores.\nConclusion:\nOne-third of older adults with mild cognitive impairment or dementia use anticholinergic medications, potentially worsening health outcomes. These findings underscore the importance of regular medication review and deprescribing strategies to minimise anticholinergic burden in this vulnerable population.\nKeywords:\nanticholinergic burden, mild cognitive impairment, dementia, hospitalisation, admission", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/121", "#/texts/122", "#/texts/123", "#/texts/124", "#/texts/125"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "02ea22ad-fcd4-4330-ac46-36f1325d9f20"}

In severe cases, healthcare professionals adopt the use of central nervous system active medication such as antipsychotics with anticholinergic properties if nonpharmacologic management is insufficient. Their widespread use raises concerns about cumulative anticholinergic burden in individuals with cognitive impairment. Although these medications are intended to alleviate symptoms such as agitation or hallucinations, their anticholinergic effects may paradoxically worsen cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms by further impairing the cholinergic pathway.\n3\nThis unintended consequence underscores the importance of evaluating anticholinergic burden in this vulnerable population.\nThe use of anticholinergic medication is prevalent among older adults with MCI or dementia, with rates ranging from 44.7% to 68.0% in the memory clinic populations.\n4\n,\n5\nA recent report by Cross et al highlighted that older adults with dementia residing in nursing homes across Asia Pacific and European countries are often prescribed strong anticholinergic medication with a high anticholinergic burden.\n6\nFrail individuals with cognitive impairment were commonly prescribed antipsychotics and antidepressants.\nAnticholinergic burden, the cumulative effect of taking multiple medications with anticholinergic properties, has been associated with worsening cognitive decline, impaired physical performance, prolonged hospitalisation, and increased mortality in older adults with dementia.\n7\nThe EPIC Norfolk longitudinal study has shown that high anticholinergic burden is linked to elevated risk of cardiovascular disease and stroke in community-dwelling older adults.\n8\n,\n9\nHowever, only a few studies have explored this risk in cognitively impaired populations.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/127", "#/texts/128", "#/texts/129", "#/texts/130", "#/texts/131", "#/texts/132", "#/texts/133", "#/texts/134", "#/texts/135", "#/texts/136", "#/texts/137", "#/texts/138", "#/texts/139", "#/texts/140", "#/texts/141", "#/texts/142", "#/texts/143", "#/texts/144", "#/texts/145", "#/texts/146", "#/texts/147"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "b0c6f66f-67ba-4354-b50d-dcf59ee2e908"}

Hospitalisation presents substantial risk for older adults with dementia, including dehydration, malnutrition, hospital-acquired infections, and worsening of neuropsychiatric symptoms, which can complicate clinical care.\n10\nFurthermore, older adults with dementia tend to be discharged from the hospital with a higher anticholinergic burden compared to their admission.\n11\nAlthough anticholinergic use has been associated with negative health outcomes, the extent to which ACB contributes to hospitalisation risk remains unclear, especially when accounting for potential confounders such as multimorbidity, frailty, and functional impairment. A deeper understanding of this association can guide deprescribing efforts and ultimately reduce preventable hospitalisations in this vulnerable population.\nPrescribing anticholinergic medication in older adults is considered potentially inappropriate, with assessment tools such as the Screening Tool of Older Person's Prescriptions and the American Geriatric Society Beers Criteria recommending avoidance or deprescribing of these medications, particularly in those with cognitively impairment.\n12\n,\n13\nDespite these recommendations, inappropriate prescribing remains widespread. In the Asia Pacific region, especially Southeast Asia, several systemic barriers such as limited awareness, insufficient geriatric training, and fragmented dementia care infrastructure contribute to suboptimal prescribing practices.\n14\n,\n15\nTo our knowledge, there are currently no standardized deprescribing interventions targeting anticholinergic medications in Southeast Asia, including Malaysia, for cognitively impaired older adults. In contrast, several international initiatives provide structured deprescribing guidance, including the NSW Therapeutic Advisory Group deprescribing tools and Primary Health Tasmania deprescribing resources.\n16\nThese gaps underscore the urgent need for locally relevant data to guide safer prescribing practices, support the development of region-specific guidelines, and improve dementia care across the region.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/148", "#/texts/149", "#/texts/150", "#/texts/151", "#/texts/152", "#/texts/153", "#/texts/154", "#/texts/155", "#/texts/156", "#/texts/157", "#/texts/158", "#/texts/159", "#/texts/160", "#/texts/161", "#/texts/162", "#/texts/163"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "382f9500-9b3a-4ae7-b4be-16d97bc4410e"}

The median time to hospitalisation from the index clinic visit was 22 (IQR 12-29) weeks. Unadjusted Cox regression identified anticholinergic exposure, men, nursing home residents, stroke, ischaemic heart disease, dependency in activities of daily living, and number of prescribed medications as factors associated with the risk of hospitalisation. ACB scores of 1-2 were associated with an increased risk of hospitalisation (Hazard Ratio= 1.84, 95% CI:1.17-2.90, p = 0.01) compared to those with an ACB score of 0 in the univariate Cox-regression analysis (\nTable 3\n). However, this association was attenuation and was no longer significant after adjusting for ischaemic heart disease, dependency in activities of daily living, and the number of prescribed medications. Those with an ACB score of \u22653 showed no association with hospitalisation risk.\nTable 3\nCox Proportional Hazard Analysis Between Hospitalisation and Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden Groups\nImage Hyperlink.\nThe hospitalisation causes stratified by ACB score groups are presented in\nTable 4\n.

Serious cardiovascular events, comprising myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, or cardiac arrhythmia, demonstrated a significant increasing trend with higher ACB scores. Infected pressure ulcers (3 in sacrum and 1 at the greater trochanter) were more frequently observed in older adults with ACB score \u22653.

Those with higher ACB scores often exhibited characteristics associated with frailty, such as residing in nursing homes, experiencing more neuropsychiatric symptoms, and having poorer cognitive and functional status. Although high anticholinergic burden was not independently associated with overall hospitalisation risk after adjustment for confounders, this attenuation suggests that ACB may serve as a surrogate marker for frailty or complex health needs, rather than a direct contributor to hospitalisation risk. Nevertheless, those hospitalised for serious adverse cardiovascular events or infected pressure ulcer had significantly higher ACB scores indicating the potential role of anticholinergic burden in precipitating specific adverse outcomes in this population.\nThe medications contributing to anticholinergic burden in older adults with MCI or dementia differs from community-dwelling older adults, possibly due to frequent use of psychotropic medications to manage neuropsychiatric symptoms. In this study, quetiapine was one of the main contributors to ACB. Emerging hypothesis suggest that high ACB may impair the cholinergic pathway, potentially worsening psychotic symptoms.\n22\nPrevious studies by Jaidi et al, showed that reducing anticholinergic burden was associated with a significantly reduction in neuropsychiatric symptoms.\n23\n,\n24\nHowever, there is a lack of subsequent research to support this association, and a Cochrane review in 2022 highlighted the absence of interventional studies that specifically assessed neuropsychiatric symptoms as an outcome.\n2\nThis represents a research gap that remains unaddressed, and high-quality studies are needed to investigate this association.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/228", "#/texts/229", "#/texts/230", "#/texts/231", "#/texts/232", "#/texts/233", "#/texts/234", "#/texts/235", "#/texts/236", "#/texts/237"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "0b1737aa-ecf0-4b49-a613-e97bc5926996"}

In large population-based national registry records of older adults from Denmark and Taiwan, anticholinergic burden was associated with an increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), with a greater burden linked to a higher risk in a dose-response pattern.\n25\n,\n26\nThis aligns with previous findings suggesting that anticholinergic medications may contribute to cardiovascular instability through pro-arrhythmic and pro-ischemic effects, tachycardia, and orthostatic hypotension, all of which can increase the risk of ischemic stroke and mortality.\n9\nAdditionally, sedation and reduced mobility due to anticholinergic use may increase the risk of pressure ulceration.

However, systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials have shown mixed results, likely due to heterogeneity in intervention design, short follow-up durations and frequency, and insufficient training provided to interventional staff.\n28\nDeprescribing anticholinergic medication can be challenging in the geriatric population. Barriers include clinician and caregiver hesitancy due to concerns about withdrawal effects, especially for psychoactive medication, lack of ownership for medications prescribed by other physicians, and limited consultation time. Medication such as analgesics, antihistamines and proton-pump inhibitor are more successfully deprescribed compared to antipsychotics or antidepressants.\n29\nA multidisciplinary team approach to address the complex needs of the older adult population is necessary, and pharmacists play a key role in offering expert guidance and support to ensure safe medication usage. A systematic review by Nguyen et al highlighted the effectiveness of pharmacist-led interventions through medication reconciliation, reviews, and adherence support in reducing anticholinergic burden.\n30\nInterventions involving medication reviews, coupled with dementia education and training for care home staff on the management of neuropsychiatric symptoms, have demonstrated success in reducing or discontinuing antipsychotic use.

With the rising prevalence of dementia in the Asia-Pacific region, understanding medication burden is critical to support the development of national policies for safe prescribing and improving dementia care. However, this study has several limitations. Firstly, the ACB scale used to quantify exposure has not been regularly updated to include newer medications, potentially underestimating the true burden. Nonetheless, it remains one of the most widely adopted and validated tool, allowing for comparison across studies.\n31\nSecondly, the retrospective design of our study relied on electronic prescription records, which may have missed non-prescribed medications, and the lack of adherence data could have affected the accuracy of the findings. Thirdly, as this was an observational study, it cannot establish causality. Future studies should include interviews on medication use and adherence to provide a more accurate and up-to-date assessment of anticholinergic exposure.\n\nAnticholinergic Burden and Its Association with Hospitalisation Risk and Causes of Admission in Older Adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment or Dementia\nConclusion\nAnticholinergic burden is observed in one-third of older adults with MCI or dementia in our setting. While no overall association with hospitalisation was found, higher ACB scores were linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular events and infected pressure ulcers among those who were hospitalised. Future research is needed to assess the long-term impact of anticholinergic burden.
