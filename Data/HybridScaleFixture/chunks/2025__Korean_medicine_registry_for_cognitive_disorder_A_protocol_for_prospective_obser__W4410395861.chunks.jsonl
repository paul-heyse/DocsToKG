In 2022, the global population aged 65 years and older will reach 770 million, tripling the 1980 figure of 258 million. The older adult population continues to grow steadily, with projections of 994 million people by 2030 and 1.6 billion by 2050 [\n1\n]. This demographic shift reflects a significant risk for cognitive impairment, resulting in a rapid increase in the number of patients with dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) worldwide [\n2\n]. The global prevalence of dementia is estimated to be approximately 55 million, with projections indicating it will increase to 139 million by 2050. Moreover, while 80% of individuals have expressed concerns regarding dementia, 25% believe nothing can be done to prevent it [\n3\n], indicating substantial apprehension regarding dementia onset. Dementia represents a severe loss of cognitive function that impairs social or occupational functioning [\n4\n], whereas MCI is considered an intermediate stage between normal aging and dementia [\n5\n]. Alzheimer's disease accounts for 60-80% of dementia cases [\n2\n,\n6\n], followed by vascular dementia at 15-30% [\n7\n]. As dementia progresses, the need for caregiving and decision-making assistance increases, with patients ultimately requiring full-time care [\n8\n]. Consequently, dementia affects not only the individuals themselves but also their families and caregivers, imposing significant burdens on medical and care services and leading to substantial social costs. The global cost of dementia was estimated at $1 trillion in 2010 [\n9\n,\n10\n] and is projected to increase by approximately 85% by 2030, reflecting the largest economic burden of any single disease [\n3\n].", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/106", "#/texts/107", "#/texts/108", "#/texts/109", "#/texts/110", "#/texts/111", "#/texts/112", "#/texts/113", "#/texts/114", "#/texts/115", "#/texts/116", "#/texts/117", "#/texts/118", "#/texts/119", "#/texts/120", "#/texts/121", "#/texts/122", "#/texts/123", "#/texts/124", "#/texts/125", "#/texts/126", "#/texts/127", "#/texts/128", "#/texts/129", "#/texts/130"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "289d61e6-9ab9-455f-8fd0-d76285bec28f"}

Vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) require treatment for cerebrovascular issues in conjunction with dementia; however, no drugs have been approved for the specific treatment of VCID [\n11\n]. Moreover, the two drugs most utilized in current treatments are cholinesterase inhibitors (e.g., donepezil hydrochloride, cabalatin, and galantamine) and excitatory amino acid receptor antagonists (memantine) [\n12\n]. However, these options are limited in scope. In addition, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have recently received accelerated approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration to initiate treatment in patients with early Alzheimer's disease with proven \u03b2-amyloid pathology (A\u03b2); however, long-term observation of brain volume loss and safety is required [\n13\n]. South Korea, which is in East Asia, is among the countries experiencing the most rapid aging worldwide. This demographic shift presents a significant healthcare challenge, as cognitive impairment prevention and management are becoming increasingly important. According to the Korean Statistical Information Service [\n14\n], in 2022, those aged 65 years and older accounted for over 18% of the total population, and this figure is projected to increase to 25.5% by 2030 and 43.8% by 2060. In contrast to the United Kingdom, which transitioned gradually from an aging society to a super-aged society over approximately 50 years, or the United States, which took approximately 15 years, Korea is expected to enter the super-aged society stage within a mere 7 years. Considering this accelerated aging, the National Institute of Dementia Annual Report 2022 [\n15\n] estimates that Korea has approximately 960,555 patients with dementia, with a prevalence of 7.3%. The projected cost of dementia management is expected to double every decade, reaching an estimated 78 trillion KRW by 2050.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/131", "#/texts/132", "#/texts/133", "#/texts/134", "#/texts/135", "#/texts/136", "#/texts/137", "#/texts/138", "#/texts/139", "#/texts/140", "#/texts/141"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "4c63e622-75aa-4eba-8778-c43442088281"}

Consequently, patients have the option to select KM or WM, or a combination of both, for treatment based on their condition and symptoms. Furthermore, the National Health Insurance Service provides coverage for KM treatments, ensuring relatively high accessibility. In order to facilitate patient convenience and effective treatment, integrative medicine is often provided as a form of collaborative care [\n16\n]. A study utilizing data from the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service found that 1.8% of all patients with dementia opted for KM treatment [\n17\n]. Furthermore, a survey conducted in 2022 on KM use revealed that 6.8% of hospital admissions to KM facilities were for dementia-related purposes [\n18\n]. However, in contrast to China, where diverse integrative management strategies for dementia and cognitive impairment are actively pursued [\n19\n], research on integrative treatment for cognitive impairment using traditional medicine is still in its nascent stages in Korea. KM has long addressed the characteristic symptoms of dementia under categories such as \"Chimae (\u7661\u5446)\" for dementia, \"Geonmang (\u5065\u5fd8)\" for forgetfulness, and \"Heoro (\u865b\u52de)\" for exhaustion [\n20\n], and several previous studies have explored the effects of traditional medicine management on dementia and cognitive impairment [\n21\n,\n22\n]. Nevertheless, despite the chronic nature of diseases such as dementia, which necessitate prolonged tracking, most studies have encountered limitations owing to the relatively short duration of the studies themselves. Another limitation of the existing research is the lack of consideration of participants' baseline characteristics and the influence of traditional medicine patterns on treatment [\n23\n]. Consequently, the systematic collection of data to assess the status and efficacy of traditional medicine in treating cognitive impairment is increasingly necessary [\n24\n]. Furthermore, although randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are considered the gold standard in evidence-based research, the importance of real-world data and evidence has been increasingly emphasized [\n25\n]. Consequently, studies that accurately reflect the actual clinical setting environment of traditional medicine institutions and systematically accumulate and manage data over extended follow-up periods are urgently needed.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/142", "#/texts/143", "#/texts/144", "#/texts/145", "#/texts/146", "#/texts/147", "#/texts/148", "#/texts/149", "#/texts/150", "#/texts/151", "#/texts/152", "#/texts/153", "#/texts/154", "#/texts/155", "#/texts/156", "#/texts/157", "#/texts/158", "#/texts/159", "#/texts/160", "#/texts/161", "#/texts/162"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "ec600f5d-8301-4b82-8308-c0f6340e6378"}

The 15 covariates are as follows: gender, age, smoking, alcohol consumption, weight, height, cognitive impairment severity, region of residence, duration of illness, income, education level, occupation, marital status, medication use, and family history. We aimed to conduct a multiple linear regression analysis to identify which covariates influence changes in MOCA-K for patients receiving Korean medicine treatment. It is generally known that multiple linear regression analysis requires approximately 20 samples for each independent variable, so the total sample size was estimated to be around 300. As this study is intended as an epidemiological investigation inherent to the nature of the registry, no predefined statistical hypotheses have been formulated. As new research questions emerge over time, additional statistical analysis plans will be devised. Consequently, each participating institution has estimated the number of eligible patients who could reasonably be registered to calculate the final sample size. The average number of patients with dementia and MCI across the three institutions is 121 per year. With an estimated registration rate of approximately 50%, the objective is to enroll 60 new participants annually, with the goal of obtaining a total of 300 new registrations in total over five years.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/202"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "6395cf33-e2e5-4f0b-93c5-5d73e100e7a7"}

In addition to determining the primary pattern, it quantitatively assesses the tendencies of other patterns. Consequently, it can be utilized for evaluating the selection of primary prescriptions for herbal medicine and acupuncture treatment, adjusting herbal dosages, selecting adjunctive acupuncture treatments, and assessing treatment progress.\nBarthel index:\nVarious versions of the Barthel Index are available. Originally, the total score ranged from 0 to 100 points; however, this study used the version revised by Collin et al. [\n28\n], which was translated into Korean as the Korean version of Barthel Activities of Daily Living Index (K-BADL) [\n29\n]]. The K-BADL assesses the ability to perform basic activities of daily living.

To provide greater sensitivity and adaptability to each country's culture, the MMSE-2 was developed, which consists of three versions: Brief Version (BV), Standard Version (SV), and Expanded Version (EV). As with the original MMSE, the K-MMSE-2:SV has a total score of 30 points. It assesses orientation to time (5 points), orientation to place (5 points), registration (3 points), attention and calculation (5 points), recall (3 points), language (8 points), and drawing (1 point). A total score of 23 points is typically considered the cutoff point for cognitive impairment.\nMontreal cognitive assessment:\nThe MoCA [\n35\n], which has been translated into Korean [\n36\n], will be used.
