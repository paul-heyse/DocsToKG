It primarily affects older adults, leading to a decline in memory, cognitive function, and the ability to carry out daily tasks. The disease is characterized by the accumulation of beta-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain, which contribute to the loss of synapses and neuronal death. Although the exact cause remains unclear, both genetic and environmental factors are believed to play significant roles in its development. Common symptoms include memory impairment, confusion, disorientation, personality changes, and difficulties in language and problem-solving.\nDiagnosis typically involves clinical evaluation, cognitive tests, neuroimaging techniques, and sometimes cerebrospinal fluid analysis to detect biomarkers. There is currently no cure for Alzheimer's, but various treatments aim to alleviate symptoms and slow the progression of the disease. These include cholinesterase inhibitors and NMDA receptor antagonists, along with supportive care and lifestyle modifications. Research is ongoing to discover disease-modifying therapies, and recent studies focus on targeting beta-amyloid production and tau protein aggregation.\nThe impact of AD is not only personal but also societal, placing immense emotional and financial strain on caregivers and healthcare systems. As global life expectancy increases, the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease is expected to rise, making early diagnosis and effective intervention strategies more critical than ever. Public awareness, support services, and continued research efforts are essential to manage and eventually prevent this debilitating condition.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/41", "#/texts/42", "#/texts/43"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "b512c9b4-86a5-4353-ab63-abe0f774067c"}
