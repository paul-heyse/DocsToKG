Databases including Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched. Outcomes were evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system, classified as \"high,\" \"moderate,\" \"low,\" or \"very low\" quality.\nResults:\nA total of 55 meta-analyses were included, covering dementia, cognitive impairment, MCI, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and stroke. Cognitive outcomes were assessed using scales like MMSE and MoCA. High-quality evidence supports Exergaming (SMD 0.69), Tai Chi (SMD 0.36), and traditional Chinese mind-body exercises (SMD 0.32) for improving MMSE and MoCA Score in MCI patients. For dementia, moderate-quality evidence shows resistance training (SMD 0.60) and Tai Chi (SMD 0.27) have positive effects. Aerobic exercise (MD 2.95) was more effective for AD, while mind-body exercises (MD 1.68) benefitted PD patients. Multi-component exercises (SMD 0.67) improved MMSE and MoCA scores in post-stroke cognitive impairment. For unspecified cognitive impairments, combining exercise with cognitive training and traditional Chinese exercises showed higher effectiveness. Due to small sample sizes, all findings were Class IV evidence, requiring further research.\nConclusion:\nModerate to high-quality evidence supports Exergaming, Tai Chi, and traditional Chinese exercises in improving cognitive function in MCI. For dementia, resistance training and Tai Chi are effective; for AD, aerobic exercise; for PD, mind-body exercises; and for post-stroke cognitive impairment, multi-component exercises are beneficial.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/171", "#/texts/172", "#/texts/173", "#/texts/174", "#/texts/175", "#/texts/176", "#/texts/177", "#/texts/178", "#/texts/179", "#/texts/180", "#/texts/181", "#/texts/182", "#/texts/183", "#/texts/184", "#/texts/185", "#/texts/186", "#/texts/187", "#/texts/188"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "5db9f28f-c842-4d96-bff4-0b70f1431dd8"}

Diseases causing cognitive dysfunction are categorized into degenerative and non-degenerative types based on their pathogenesis. Degenerative conditions comprise Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), while non-degenerative conditions include vascular dementia and brain trauma. These conditions pose significant health risks to middle-aged and elderly populations, affecting quality of life and placing a dual burden on social and economic systems (\nWang et al., 2019\n). Currently, approximately 43.8 million people worldwide are affected by cognitive impairments, with 10.427 million in China. It is estimated that by 2050, the global number of affected individuals will reach 152 million (\nRen R. J. et al., 2021\n). Among the Chinese population aged 60 and above, the prevalence of MCI and dementia is 15.5 and 6.0%, respectively (\nJia et al., 2020\n). Cognitive impairment not only contributes to specific diseases such as Alzheimer's but also interacts with various health conditions and lifestyle factors, becoming a significant indicator of overall health. It is widely believed that cognitive impairments, if left untreated, will progress to dementia, an irreversible neurodegenerative disease with no current treatment options. As cognitive function declines, the burden on individuals, families, and society increases.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/189", "#/texts/190", "#/texts/191", "#/texts/193", "#/texts/194", "#/texts/195", "#/texts/196", "#/texts/197", "#/texts/198", "#/texts/199"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "c879ff5c-cd79-407c-8bec-f6da321c59df"}

Scholars have emphasized its significant role in preventing and improving cognitive dysfunction (\nHuang et al., 2020\n). Numerous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated the positive effects of physical activity on cognitive dysfunction (\nMollinedo Cardalda et al., 2019\n;\nLangoni et al., 2019\n) and its ability to enhance brain plasticity (\nBolandzadeh et al., 2015\n;\nGajewski and Falkenstein, 2016\n). However, some studies report that exercise does not significantly improve cognitive impairment (\nTang et al., 2016\n). While several meta-analyses have demonstrated the positive impact of physical activity on cognitive functions in patients with cognitive impairments, factors such as the diverse causes of cognitive dysfunction in study populations, the types and intensities of exercise interventions, and the varying durations of the studies prevent a definitive conclusion. Questions remain regarding the effectiveness of exercise for patients with different types of cognitive impairments, which specific exercises are most effective, and whether the improvements vary across different diseases.\nCognitive impairment is a multifactorial condition, and evaluating intervention measures can provide clinicians with effective prevention strategies. This review examines published systematic reviews and performs a meta-analysis on the effects of physical activity on cognitive function in patients with diverse cognitive impairments. It also employs the AMSTAR 2 tool to appraise the methodological quality of these studies and utilizes the GRADE system to determine the reliability of evidence for the intervention effect estimates.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/200", "#/texts/201", "#/texts/202", "#/texts/203", "#/texts/204", "#/texts/205", "#/texts/206", "#/texts/207", "#/texts/208", "#/texts/209", "#/texts/210", "#/texts/211", "#/texts/212", "#/texts/213"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "cf80177f-016b-416f-a162-a17f937be4f9"}

If meta-analyses were published within 24 months of each other, priority was given to the one with the most RCTs. If the number of RCTs was the same, the meta-analysis with the higher AMSTAR score was prioritized.

Heterogeneity was assessed with I\n2\nand Cochran's Q test, while small-study effects were examined with the Egger or Begg tests (for meta-analyses with &gt;10 studies), as appropriate (\nTheodoratou et al., 2014\n;\nHuang Y. et al., 2021\n;\nEgger et al., 1997\n). For dietary interventions rated as Class I-II (high or moderate quality), sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate the impact of individual studies on the overall findings. Dose-response analyses were performed for exercise interventions targeting cognitive impairment in patients. In cases where recent meta-analyses excluded clinical studies from earlier analyses, the data were merged and subjected to reanalysis.

A cross-sectional study has highlighted the correlation between muscle strength and the incidence of MCI, suggesting that resistance training targeting muscle strength could serve as a preventive measure against MCI (\nVancampfort et al., 2019\n).

It has gender-specific effects on cognition, glucose metabolism, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and nutritional activities in patients with cognitive impairments. Moderate-intensity aerobic exercise can enhance overall cognitive performance in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (\nSong et al., 2018\n). Research has shown that aerobic exercise significantly increases the levels of BDNF, which is essential for enhancing cognitive abilities and brain development. Dance, as a form of aerobic exercise, is unique due to its requirement for complex and frequent changes in body posture, spatial positioning, steps, and rhythm. These characteristics demand greater attention, memory, control, and execution from participants. Additionally, the combination of dance and music, rich in emotional and spiritual elements, stimulates imagination and perception, further activating various cognitive functions and extensive neural pathways in the brain. During dance interventions, changes in musical rhythm and body positioning activate spatial perception neurons, contributing to brain function remodeling (\nDoeller et al., 2010\n;\nHafting et al., 2005\n). Regular limb movements, by increasing levels of BDNF and other growth factors, promote the enhancement of neural structures and delay neurodegenerative changes (\nColcombe et al., 2003\n), thereby improving cognitive abilities (\nFoster et al., 2011\n). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have shown that dance helps prevent degeneration in the brain's callosal region. The integrity of white matter in this area is crucial for processing speed (\nBurzynska et al., 2017\n), which is essential for cognitive functions and information processing (\nSalthouse, 1996\n). Therefore, long-term engagement in dance activities can positively affect cognitive domains including memory, attention, spatial perception, and executive function. These effects are closely linked to brain structure and functional plasticity (\nAgui\u00f1aga and Marquez, 2017\n;\nHo et al., 2015\n).", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/809", "#/texts/810", "#/texts/811", "#/texts/812", "#/texts/813", "#/texts/814", "#/texts/815", "#/texts/816", "#/texts/817", "#/texts/818", "#/texts/819", "#/texts/820", "#/texts/821", "#/texts/822", "#/texts/823", "#/texts/824", "#/texts/825", "#/texts/826", "#/texts/827"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "a84fd8c8-2066-436c-85cf-405e7ae431b6"}

Due to its generally low to moderate intensity and slow pace, it is particularly suitable for individuals with weak constitutions, especially those experiencing cognitive decline or exercise intolerance (\nWang et al., 2018\n). Traditional Chinese mind-body exercises, such as Tai Chi, Qigong and Baduanjin have demonstrated significant improvements in cognitive functions, with high-quality evidence supporting their efficacy. Tai Chi, a central component of traditional Chinese culture (\nNyman et al., 2019\n), integrates the principles of traditional philosophy, including Yin and Yang, the Five Elements (\nZou et al., 2019\n), and meridian theories from traditional Chinese medicine. This practice emphasizes \"integrating form and spirit\" and the \"unity of man and nature,\" enhancing mental well-being through physical exercises that incorporate guiding techniques and controlled breathing. From a modern medical perspective, Tai Chi is recognized as an exercise that involves complex movement sequences requiring coordination and precise posture control. Practicing Tai Chi promotes blood circulation, regulates the autonomic nervous system (\nSun et al., 2019\n), strengthens muscles, and improves balance, thereby supporting cognitive function.

Compared to single-mode exercises, combining various exercise modalities has a broader and more beneficial impact on older adults, potentially exerting a greater influence on cognition than either aerobic or strength training alone (\nDent et al., 2019\n). This integrated approach, combining aerobic with strength training, more effectively reduces cardiovascular risk factors. These exercises, by influencing the deposition of abnormal proteins, increasing levels of neurotrophic factors including BDNF and nerve growth factor, improving cerebral blood flow, and reducing systemic inflammation, can prevent neurodegenerative changes and slow cognitive decline in elderly frail patients (\nKirk-Sanchez and McGough, 2014\n). Recent studies have also shown that strength and coordination training positively impact cognitive health (\nChang et al., 2012\n;\nVoelcker-Rehage et al., 2011\n). Multicomponent exercises not only improve the logical and memory abilities of older patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment but also slow the atrophy of the cerebral cortex, significantly benefiting cognitive functions in the elderly (\nSuzuki et al., 2013\n). This exercise mode, which integrates aerobic, strength, and balance training, outperforms single aerobic training in significantly enhancing attention and working memory (\nSmith et al., 2010\n). Research confirms that structured, personalized, high-intensity, long-duration multicomponent exercise programs help preserve cognitive abilities in older adults (\nKirk-Sanchez and McGough, 2014\n).\nEmerging Exergaming methods can enhance cognitive functions by providing diverse cognitive stimuli, promoting cooperation between various brain regions, and improving neuroplasticity.

Furthermore, the selection of exercise types is influenced by patients' motor capacity and intervention objectives. It must be emphasized that significant individual variability exists - the following analysis represents general theoretical considerations that may help delay progression of various symptomatic cognitive impairments, serve preventive functions, and provide clinical references. For MCI patients in early-stage cognitive decline who require both cognitive reserve enhancement and motor function maintenance, exergaming is particularly recommended. This intervention combines physical movement with cognitive tasks (e.g., rapid decision-making, spatial navigation) and dual-task training to activate frontal and hippocampal regions, potentially stimulating neuroplasticity. The interactive design of exergaming may further enhance patient engagement and compliance. Alzheimer's disease patients frequently exhibit reduced cerebral metabolism and cerebrovascular risks. Aerobic exercise may indirectly preserve cognitive function through comprehensive cardiovascular benefits, potentially improving synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis via enhanced cerebral blood flow, hippocampal volume expansion, and BDNF secretion, thereby potentially slowing neurodegenerative progression. Late-stage dementia patients often experience physical functional decline with elevated fall risks. Resistance training could support neuronal health through increased muscle mass and IGF-1 levels, potentially reducing systemic inflammation. Importantly, muscle strength and daily function maintenance are crucial for preserving independence. Parkinson's disease patients with motor coordination deficits from nigrostriatal dopamine neuron loss may benefit from Tai Chi's slow, controlled movements and breathing regulation. This mind-body practice enhances dopaminergic system function, improves balance/gait stability (via basal ganglia-cerebellar circuits), reduces stress hormones (e.g., cortisol), and alleviates rigidity/tremor. Tai Chi's low-intensity nature minimizes fall risks while its integrated mind-body approach better meets neuromodulatory needs compared to isolated physical training. Post-stroke cognitive impairment often involves motor limitations and heterogeneous regional brain damage.

Additionally, it offers a theoretical foundation for developing more clinically effective exercise interventions and provides guidance for future clinical research.\nIt is important to note that this paper highlights significant heterogeneity in 81% of the results (I\n2\n&gt; 50% or Cochran's Q test\np", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/862", "#/texts/863", "#/texts/864", "#/texts/865", "#/texts/866", "#/texts/867"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "6b53089e-676e-42bb-842a-792ff6feedc4"}

First, the search was restricted to English-language databases, which may have introduced bias by omitting studies published in other languages. Second, only published data were considered, potentially excluding unpublished or forthcoming evidence. Third, we extracted and analyzed data from existing systematic reviews and meta-analyses, excluding original research not covered in these reviews, as well as studies based on network meta-analyses, due to unclear methods for interpreting network and pairwise meta-analysis results. All included studies were rated as non-significant evidence class. Finally, as this is a triplicate analysis based on meta-analysis, it was not possible to perform subgroup analyses to identify the main components affecting the outcome in question. Despite these limitations, this umbrella review comprehensively documents, for the first time, the existing evidence on the improvement of cognitive functions in patients with cognitive impairments through exercise interventions as reported in previous meta-analyses. By evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of existing evidence-based studies on exercise interventions for improving cognitive functions in patients with cognitive impairments, this article helps clarify exercise strategies for preventing cognitive decline in the elderly. It provides a theoretical basis for designing more effective prevention and management strategies for cognitive impairment in clinical practice and offers guidance for future clinical research. This research followed a rigorous systematic approach. Two independent researchers performed literature searches, screened studies, and extracted relevant data. When adequate information was available, we re-analyzed the mean differences (MD) or SMD with 95% CI using either a random-effects or fixed-effects model. We comprehensively evaluated the heterogeneity and publication bias of each included meta-analysis. Furthermore, three established approaches-AMSTAR, GRADE, and evidence classification criteria-were utilized to assess the methodological rigor and categorize the evidence for each risk factor, allowing us to gauge our confidence in the estimates.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/870"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "dd484b23-4799-434d-988c-b4b1bfab83ae"}

In dementia patients, both resistance training and Tai Chi have shown beneficial effects. Aerobic exercise is particularly effective for individuals with Alzheimer's disease, while mind-body exercises provide advantages for Parkinson's disease patients. Additionally, multi-component exercises are beneficial for those with cognitive impairments following a stroke. These findings highlight the positive effect of tailored exercise programs on cognitive performance across various cognitive disorders. However, this review has limitations, including potential bias in original data, heterogeneity, and the overall lower quality of some studies. Therefore, further prospective studies are necessary to confirm the impact of various types of physical activity on cognitive performance improvement and assess their safety in treating cognitive impairments caused by various etiologies. Such studies will provide the latest and comprehensive evidence for guiding exercise interventions aimed at improving cognitive functions in patients with cognitive impairments in clinical settings.\n\nEffects of exercise interventions on cognitive function in patients with cognitive dysfunction: an umbrella review of meta-analyses\nData availability statement\nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/\nSupplementary material\n, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/872", "#/texts/874", "#/texts/875", "#/texts/876"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "cbf4e5cd-dee4-4806-a132-ed21a3b4468e"}
