By delineating its transformation from a descriptive tool to a predictive framework, we highlight persistent challenges such as methodological heterogeneity and small sample sizes. However, advances in machine learning and multicenter collaborations present opportunities to standardize protocols. Future high-quality studies are expected to establish gait-derived biomarkers as clinically actionable tools in MCI stratification and therapeutic monitoring.\n\nGait analysis in older adults with mild cognitive impairment: a bibliometric analysis of global trends, hotspots, and emerging frontiers\n1 Introduction\nMild cognitive impairment (MCI) is prevalent among older populations, with incidence rates escalating alongside age (\nPetersen et al., 2014\n). Characterized by progressive memory or cognitive decline, MCI does not severely impair daily functioning nor meet diagnostic thresholds for dementia (\nJia et al., 2020\n). Epidemiological studies indicate that older adults with MCI face a significantly elevated risk of progressing to dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD), with an estimated 10%-15% of MCI patients transitioning to AD annually (\nNelson et al., 2021\n;\nAuthor Anonymous, 2024\n).\nAs an intermediate transitional stage between normal aging and dementia (\nAnderson, 2019\n), MCI exhibits variable trajectories: cognitive decline may stabilize, reverse, or deteriorate into dementia (\nPetersen, 2004\n;\nSoldan et al., 2017\n). Consequently, early detection and intervention in older adults experiencing cognitive decline present a critical opportunity to delay progression from MCI to dementia. Such efforts are vital for mitigating disease severity and enhancing patients' quality of life (\nLanga and Levine, 2014\n).", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/207", "#/texts/208", "#/texts/210", "#/texts/211", "#/texts/212", "#/texts/213", "#/texts/214", "#/texts/215", "#/texts/216", "#/texts/217", "#/texts/218", "#/texts/219", "#/texts/220", "#/texts/221", "#/texts/222", "#/texts/223", "#/texts/224", "#/texts/225", "#/texts/226", "#/texts/227"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "55323d33-caa5-4122-85c8-0844a8f66817"}

Cognitive decline manifests as deterioration in memory, attention, and executive function, while gait abnormalities include slow gait speed, gait initiation failure, and increased fall risk, all of which subtly impact daily functioning (\nAllali et al., 2017\n;\nLindh-Rengifo et al., 2022\n;\nKim et al., 2023\n). In 2003, a multidisciplinary and international expert panel (comprising global specialists from Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America) explicitly concluded through structured discussions that integrating gait analysis and neuropsychological testing could aid in both early detection of MCI and prediction of its clinical progression, reaching a consensus (\nWinblad et al., 2004\n). According to Chinese clinical guidelines (evidence of level I) (\nCDYcDdatgc, 2018\n), gait performance serves as a biomarker for identifying cognitive decline. Gait analysis technology leverages anatomical and physiological principles to assess walking patterns and quantify spatiotemporal and joint kinematics parameters. These metrics help detect gait alterations linked to cognitive decline, thereby identifying potential biomarkers for MCI (\nZhong et al., 2021\n;\nCicirelli et al., 2022\n;\nAznielle-Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2023\n). Aging involves biomolecular mechanisms such as cellular senescence, mitochondrial dysfunction, and epigenetic alterations, which disrupt processes like genomic stability and proteostasis, ultimately impairing cognitive and motor functions (\nWagner et al., 2016\n;\nRizzuto et al., 2017\n). Thus, integrating gait analysis with cognitive assessments in clinical and research settings highlights the critical interplay between physiological and neurological health.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/228", "#/texts/229", "#/texts/230", "#/texts/231", "#/texts/232", "#/texts/233", "#/texts/234", "#/texts/235", "#/texts/236", "#/texts/237", "#/texts/238", "#/texts/239", "#/texts/240", "#/texts/241", "#/texts/242", "#/texts/243", "#/texts/244", "#/texts/245", "#/texts/246", "#/texts/247", "#/texts/248", "#/texts/249", "#/texts/250"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "2b685602-e6d1-41d6-a506-e22a42f98a70"}

Bibliometric analysis, a quantitative statistical method, examines patterns in academic research to evaluate its characteristics and societal impact, and has been widely applied across disciplines (\nHicks et al., 2015\n). Despite advances in MCI-related gait research, the absence of bibliometric analyses hinders comprehensive synthesis of progress, posing challenges for researchers.\nTo address this gap, we employed Microsoft Excel, CiteSpace and VOSviewer to visually analysis of the publication, countries, institutions, journals, authors, keywords and references in MCI gait studies over the past 20 years. We have conducted a comprehensive analysis of literature spanning 2005 to 2024 in this field, with particular focus on delineating the current research landscape, emerging frontiers, and global hotspots and trends.

To ensure comprehensive insights into gait analysis and MCI in older adults populations, this study employed a multi-tool approach: Microsoft Office Excel for data management and trend analysis, CiteSpace for visualizing research networks and frontiers, and VOSviewer for constructing bibliometric networks.\nCitespace is a widely useful bibliometric visualization analysis software, mainly used to describe research hotspots, explore existing scientific fields and academic networks, and identify research trends (\nChen, 2004\n;\nChen, 2006\n). CiteSpace generates a network map comprising tree-ring nodes and connecting lines. The tree-ring nodes denote analyzed entities (e.g., keywords, institutions), with node size reflecting frequency, color indicating publication year, and purple peripheries signaling high betweenness centrality (critical nodes in collaboration networks) (\nLiu et al., 2019\n). The connecting lines represent co-occurrence relationships, with thickness denoting connection strength and color marking the year of first co-occurrence. Cool-to-warm color transitions reflect temporal progression (\nSong et al., 2022\n). Additionally, the timeline viewer facilitates historical cluster analysis, identifies foundational references within clusters, and tracks fluctuations in scholarly attention over time. Occurrence bursts in CiteSpace, characterized by abrupt increases in term frequency during defined time intervals, serve as indicators of paradigm shifts in research frontiers and disciplinary dynamics (\nMa et al., 2021\n;\nXu et al., 2024\n). Nodes exhibiting active burst periods are projected to maintain this growth trajectory for a foreseeable duration (\nChen et al., 2024\n). Furthermore, CiteSpace's dual-map overlay function visualizes knowledge transfer patterns: the left matrix maps citing journals (reflecting emerging research domains), while the right matrix positions cited journals (denoting foundational literature). The curvature bandwidth quantitatively represents citation intensity through two metrics-fluctuation magnitude (z-score) and occurrence density (f-score) (\nYang et al., 2024\n).", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/274", "#/texts/275", "#/texts/276", "#/texts/277", "#/texts/278", "#/texts/279", "#/texts/280", "#/texts/281", "#/texts/282", "#/texts/283", "#/texts/284", "#/texts/285", "#/texts/286", "#/texts/287", "#/texts/288", "#/texts/289", "#/texts/290", "#/texts/291", "#/texts/292", "#/texts/293"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "c56cf041-fd75-45b3-8b1b-5c34e8439eb0"}

In a collaboration network, each node represents a different object, and the size of the nodes is determined by their frequency of occurrence and citation, or the weight of their connections (\nArruda et al., 2022\n). The connecting lines between nodes represent their degree of contact, and the thicker lines indicate stronger links. Various clusters are represented in different colors and often represent different directions of research (\nSun et al., 2024\n).\nThis study employed Microsoft Excel 2019 to analyze publication trends over the past two decades and forecast future publication volumes, while also facilitating data management (\nLiu et al., 2024\n). CiteSpace 6.4. R1 generated collaborative network graphs for countries, institutions, and dual-map overlays of journals, alongside identifying citation bursts for keywords and references. Centrality metrics were applied to identify and quantify influential nodes within these networks (\nJiao et al., 2022\n). By detecting citation bursts in keywords and references, emerging research frontiers were identified, reflecting concentrated scholarly attention during specific periods (\nChen et al., 2024\n). VOSviewer 1.6.19 constructed the following networks: co-authorship networks for countries and institutions, citation networks for journals and authors, keyword co-occurrence networks, co-citation networks for authors and references (\nSun et al., 2024\n). In addition, Scimago was used to generate a world map to present the cooperation between countries (\nRocamora-Montenegro et al., 2021\n).", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/294", "#/texts/295", "#/texts/296", "#/texts/297", "#/texts/298", "#/texts/299", "#/texts/300", "#/texts/301", "#/texts/302", "#/texts/303", "#/texts/304", "#/texts/305", "#/texts/306", "#/texts/307", "#/texts/308", "#/texts/309", "#/texts/310", "#/texts/311"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "33530937-6a70-4a42-ab41-b268d5f00037"}

Any identified discrepancies were resolved through iterative verification by a third researcher until complete analytical consensus was achieved among all three investigators.\n\nGait analysis in older adults with mild cognitive impairment: a bibliometric analysis of global trends, hotspots, and emerging frontiers\n3 Results\n3.1 Annual publications and trends\nThe deduplication process, performed using CiteSpace, confirmed the absence of duplicate records, resulting in a final inclusion of 1,223 publications.\nFigure 2A\nillustrates annual publication counts from 2005 to 2024, while\nFigure 2B\npresents a polynomial regression model (R\n2\n= 0.9593) fitted to cumulative publication data, indicating a transition toward a plateau phase in MCI-related gait research. Publications surged from 10 in 2005 to 132 in 2021, peaking before stabilizing at 109 in 2023. This fluctuating yet upward trajectory underscores sustained scholarly focus on gait analysis in older adults with MCI, particularly over the past 5 years. The retrieval was conducted on 15 December 2024, and the search showed that 77 studies were published that year. Accounting for publication delays and ongoing research advancements, further growth in novel gait studies targeting MCI is anticipated.\nFigure 2\nFigure 2\n.

Over the past 5 years, publication rates have stabilized, averaging over 100 articles annually, reflecting sustained scholarly interest in MCI-related gait research (\nFigure 2\n). This trend may stem from the multifactorial health challenges and clinical complexity of older adults populations with MCI, coupled with its interdisciplinary management framework. Analysis based on the biopsychosocial model of the World Health Organization's International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (WHO-ICF) demonstrates that gait abnormalities in older adults with MCI result from multidimensional interactions within this framework. Within the ICF Body Functions domain, dysfunction in the prefrontal-basal ganglia circuitry may contribute to altered gait cycle phases and increased stride variability (\nMacfarlane et al., 2015\n). The Activity domain reflects gait-cognitive dual-task interference induced by executive dysfunction, elevating spatial navigation error rates (\nArgento et al., 2021\n). In the Participation domain, reduced community engagement and diminished efficiency in instrumental daily activities among individuals with MCI exhibit a dose-response relationship with impaired gait control (\nBracco et al., 2023\n). Environmental factor analysis in the ICF context indicates that complex terrains substantially heighten fall risk in this population (\nPottorf et al., 2022\n). Increasing recognition of gait abnormalities in MCI by patients and clinicians underscores its future clinical and research significance.\nAmong the top 10 countries/regions by publication output, the United States leads in productivity, centrality, and citation impact, highlighting robust international collaboration among American researchers (\nTable 1\n). England and Australia also exhibit strong centrality, signaling expanding global cooperation in this field. Conversely, Canada and China, despite high publication volumes, currently display lower centrality due to their more recent entry into the field.

Institutions from the United States and Australia played pivotal roles in facilitating collaboration among the research teams (\nTable 1\n). In general, most institutions were fragmented, lacking stable and deep cooperation and exchange relationships (\nFigure 4\n). While striving to foster innovative discoveries, institutions must further strengthen cooperation with other organizations. By sharing resources, knowledge, and technologies across institutions, global collaboration can accelerate research cycles and optimize clinical solutions.

His seminal work includes a prospective cohort study (\nMontero-Odasso et al., 2017\n) that conducted 6-year follow-up assessments of 112 community-dwelling older adults to investigate associations between DT gait performance and incident dementia in mild cognitive impairment patients. Results demonstrated no association between slow single-task gait speed (\nMontero-Odasso et al., 2017\n).\nTinetti Mary E. is from Yale University, the United States, possessing the strongest centrality in the field. Her current research focuses on clinical decision-making for older adults with multiple chronic conditions and the significance of universal health outcomes applicable across diseases in aging populations (\nGill et al., 1995\n). She developed the\nTinetti Performance-Oriented Mobility Assessment (POMA)\n(\nTinetti, 1986\n) a tool widely employed to assess balance and gait in older adults and stroke survivors. The POMA emphasizes action-oriented rehabilitation evaluation, serving not only to measure mobility, balance, and fall risk but also to inform tailored fall prevention strategies, monitor longitudinal changes in mobility and balance, and evaluate rehabilitation efficacy (\nTinetti, 1986\n).", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/505", "#/texts/506", "#/texts/507", "#/texts/508", "#/texts/509", "#/texts/510", "#/texts/511", "#/texts/512", "#/texts/513", "#/texts/514", "#/texts/515", "#/texts/516", "#/texts/517", "#/texts/518", "#/texts/519", "#/texts/520", "#/texts/521", "#/texts/522", "#/texts/523", "#/texts/524", "#/texts/525", "#/texts/526", "#/texts/527", "#/texts/528"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "d1d1f43a-9472-49cd-a3e6-a29e96ec3d8a"}

Epidemiologically, AD constitutes the most prevalent dementia subtype, accounting for 50%-70% of cases (\nRostagno, 2022\n). AD is characterized by progressive memory decline, often accompanied by impairments in speech, executive function, visuospatial skills, and behavioral abnormalities (\nMantzavinos and Alexiou, 2017\n). MCI represents the early stage of AD's disease continuum, where early diagnosis, intervention, and precision therapies critically delay progression (\nRostagno, 2022\n). Based on MCI subtypes, aMCI typically advances to AD, whereas naMCI may evolve into vascular dementia or frontotemporal dementia (\nBradfield, 2023\n). Notably, gait abnormalities manifest more prominently in aMCI than naMCI (\nMasse et al., 2021\n).

During pPD, non-motor or mild motor symptoms (e.g., cognitive impairment) emerge without meeting PD diagnostic criteria (\nMahlknecht et al., 2022\n). Furthermore, MCI often marks the transition from pPD to PD and correlates with PD-dementia risk (\nPan et al., 2022\n). A cohort study (\nBougea et al., 2019\n) of 1,629 older adults (aged \u226565 years) demonstrated higher pPD prevalence in MCI patients than cognitively healthy controls, with pPD incidence linked to deficits across cognitive domains.

Over the past two decades, gait studies on MCI have evolved through distinct phases. Bibliometric indicators from the first decade reveal a focus on mechanistic investigations of gait performance in MCI (particularly under DT conditions), pathological correlates in specific cortical regions, and the neurodegenerative continuum linking MCI to AD and PD. Concurrently, significant attention was directed toward physical activity interventions in community-dwelling older adults. In the subsequent decade, research shifted toward leveraging wearable 3D gait analysis technologies to extract gait metrics and applying artificial intelligence (AI)-driven algorithms to develop diagnostic models for improved MCI detection accuracy.\nA keyword-based cluster analysis delineated nine thematic clusters (\nFigure 7C\n), which were further examined via timeline mapping to identify emerging frontiers. The primary themes include: #0 physical activity, #1 gait, #2 intraindividual variability, #3 dementia, #4 brain atrophy, #5 postural control, #6 white matter hyperintensities, #7 hearing loss, #8 vascular dementia. Among these themes, cluster (#0) exhibited the highest keyword density, strongest intra-cluster cohesion, and the longest temporal span, underscoring its sustained dominance as a foundational and evolving research priority in this field.\nKeywords exhibiting strong citation bursts are indicative of emerging research frontiers (\nFigure 7B\n).

Current 3D gait analysis systems employ marker-based motion-capture technology to objectively quantify multi-dimensional gait parameters (\nLo et al., 2022\n;\nMartini et al., 2022\n). The platform achieves sub-millimeter accuracy, positioning them as robust tools for MCI identification (\nScataglini et al., 2024\n). Systematic characterization of gait patterns and analysis of gait abnormality etiologies have identified subtle biomechanical signatures linked to MCI (\nMarquis et al., 2002\n). While spatiotemporal parameters (e.g., gait speed, stride length, stance/swing phase duration) often overlap between MCI and cognitively healthy older adults, their dynamic alterations serve as critical biomarkers for MCI progression (\nGuan et al., 2022\n;\nLindh-Rengifo et al., 2022\n;\nWindham et al., 2022\n;\nMo et al., 2024\n). Joint angle metrics, particularly toe-off and heel-contact angles, further discriminate cognitive impairment levels (\nNi et al., 2021\n;\nWang et al., 2023\n).\nAdditionally, DT gait analysis add additional cognitive load (such as cognitive tasks involving attention, memory, execution ability, etc.) to the walking task so that to expose functional deficits (\nMcIsaac et al., 2015\n). Underlying the DT gait paradigm, MCI patients with insufficient cognitive reserve are difficult to complete the walking and cognitive tasks simultaneously, resulting in obvious gait changes (e.g., reduced gait speed), which enhance diagnostic sensitivity of MCI (\nYang et al., 2020\n;\nWeng et al., 2023\n). Such paradigms also predict fall risk and evaluate cognitive-motor integration, demonstrating utility in MCI screening (\nGhai et al., 2017\n;\nLiu et al., 2017\n).", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/569", "#/texts/570", "#/texts/571", "#/texts/572", "#/texts/573", "#/texts/574", "#/texts/575", "#/texts/576", "#/texts/577", "#/texts/578", "#/texts/579", "#/texts/580", "#/texts/581", "#/texts/582", "#/texts/583", "#/texts/584", "#/texts/585", "#/texts/586", "#/texts/587", "#/texts/588", "#/texts/589", "#/texts/590", "#/texts/591", "#/texts/592", "#/texts/593", "#/texts/594", "#/texts/595", "#/texts/596", "#/texts/597", "#/texts/598", "#/texts/599", "#/texts/600"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "8de2cba4-52e4-475e-bd8e-8e5b6a1625b4"}

First, neuropathological studies have confirmed that abnormal deposition of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) protein is closely associated with memory and language cognitive domains, and its dysregulated production and clearance mechanisms have been identified as potential initiating factors for AD (\nHarrington et al., 2013\n), providing critical insights for MCI diagnosis. Tau positron emission tomography (Tau-PET) demonstrates promise as a biomarker for predicting cognitive trajectory in preclinical and prodromal AD stages (\nOssenkoppele et al., 2021\n). However, the lack of definitive MCI-specific biomarkers persists, as its pathological features substantially overlap with dementia and age-related cognitive changes (\nPetersen et al., 2014\n). Neuropathological and longitudinal studies highlight the heterogeneity of MCI, with pathological markers existing along a spectrum between normal cognition and dementia (\nStephan et al., 2012\n). Furthermore, MCI's multifactorial etiology including spanning vascular, neurodegenerative, and metabolic pathways, complicates the identification of a singular diagnostic biomarker. Besides, current diagnostic practices rely on semi-quantitative neuropsychological tests such as the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) (\nLiu et al., 2021\n), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) (\nNasreddine et al., 2005\n), Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) (\nTariot et al., 2024\n). However, these tools exhibit limited sensitivity, high subjectivity, and cultural bias. Consequently, establishing a comprehensive, multidimensional diagnostic framework has emerged as an urgent clinical imperative.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/610", "#/texts/611", "#/texts/612", "#/texts/613", "#/texts/614", "#/texts/615", "#/texts/616", "#/texts/617", "#/texts/618", "#/texts/619", "#/texts/620", "#/texts/621", "#/texts/622", "#/texts/623", "#/texts/624"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "d6cf14e4-7e0e-4d71-aa4a-526d17de935a"}

DT-based gait analysis has demonstrated significant potential, revealing gait parameters closely linked to MCI (such as stride length variability, swing phase asymmetry) (\nBahureksa et al., 2017\n). However, these parameters are susceptible to intraindividual variability, environmental confounders, and multicollinearity, limiting their standalone diagnostic utility (\nVerghese et al., 2008\n). Machine learning (ML) as a AI-driven algorithms can address these limitations by identifying and integrating high-impact gait features (e.g., dynamic joint angles, DTC) into predictive models, thereby enhancing diagnostic accuracy (\nTao. et al., 2022\n). For instance,\nGhoraani et al. (2021)\ndeveloped a Support Vector Machine (SVM)-based DT gait assessment method to objectively diagnose MCI and AD, and effectively distinguish them from cognitively intact subjects. Despite these advances, optimal ML architectures (e.g., deep learning vs ensemble methods) for MCI diagnosis remain underexplored, necessitating prospective multicenter studies to validate digital biomarker-driven diagnostic frameworks.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/625", "#/texts/626", "#/texts/627", "#/texts/628", "#/texts/629", "#/texts/630", "#/texts/631", "#/texts/632", "#/texts/633"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "17f23529-fd2a-4c15-b02b-d3d29d5cbce8"}

Significant breakthroughs have been made in A\u03b2-targeted disease-modifying therapies (DMT), with multiple anti-A\u03b2 monoclonal antibodies completing Phase III clinical trials (\nLeuzy et al., 2023\n). Among these, lecanemab has received marketing approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Japan Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA), and China National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) for treating MCI patients (\nTahami Monfared et al., 2023\n). In addition to DMT drugs, symptomatic medications may be used in clinical management to enhance cognition or alleviate neuropsychiatric symptoms in MCI patients. However, although cholinesterase inhibitors are the primary symptomatic treatment for AD dementia, their efficacy in MCI remains uncertain (\nHan et al., 2019\n).\nCurrent non-pharmacological approaches for MCI treatment are also gaining attention. Multimodal interventions targeting modifiable risk factors such as nutrition, sleep optimization, physical activity, and social engagement may help delay cognitive decline (\nKivipelto et al., 2013\n). Among these, cognitive-motor DT training has emerged as the most widely validated intervention. Integrated DT protocols synergistically enhance cognitive function and ADLs in MCI patients, outperforming single-domain interventions (\nGavelin et al., 2021\n). A systematic review by Ali et al. (\nAli et al., 2022\n) demonstrated that DT training significantly improves cognitive performance, gait stability, and balance in older adults across cognitive impairment stages, though optimal intensity and duration require further standardization.\nThese trends highlight three priorities for future research: (1) establishing validated DT gait paradigms for early MCI detection, (2) leveraging AI-driven algorithm to develop gait-based diagnostic models, and (3) personalizing cognitive-motor DT interventions to mitigate fall risk, enhance functional independence, and decelerate dementia progression.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/634", "#/texts/635", "#/texts/636", "#/texts/637", "#/texts/638", "#/texts/639", "#/texts/640", "#/texts/641", "#/texts/642", "#/texts/643", "#/texts/644", "#/texts/645", "#/texts/646", "#/texts/647", "#/texts/648"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "cafe7acc-7cac-483d-b9b8-2203ee73f792"}

With most MCI patients residing in community settings, demand for home-based wearable devices and VR platforms is growing (\nLiao et al., 2020\n). Tortora et al.

First, the study relied exclusively on the WoSCC database due to technical constraints and the scope of the visualization software (including CiteSpace and VOSviewer), potentially omitting relevant literature from other databases. While, other databases were consulted as supplementary references to identify pertinent publications and examine emerging trends and research frontiers in the field. Future research will not only consider using other format conversion tools to export data from databases such as PubMed into WoS-style formatting, but also incorporate cited and citing reference information from citation databases like EI Compendex and Scopus. This approach would expand the literature data volume to enable more comprehensive and detailed visual network analysis of this field. Second, excluding non-English articles may have introduced selection bias. Third, bibliometric methods inherently lack the capacity to evaluate the scientific validity or methodological rigor of publications. For example, recent studies may be underrepresented due to delayed citation accrual, and citation metrics can be skewed by temporal biases. Consequently, certain articles may have been overlooked, underscoring the need for methodological refinements in future bibliometric investigations of MCI-related gait research.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/681"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "11350f22-d2f5-494c-bd31-a1d818597bcc"}

CiteSpace and VOSviewer visual analyses indicate sustained prominence in MCI gait research over the past 5 years. Historically, the United States has dominated this field globally, though collaboration among other countries and institutions remains fragmented, as many entered the field only recently. Leading journals and authors predominantly focus on AD, gerontology, and neurology. Keyword and reference analyses suggest that DT gait analysis, a critical tool for identifying MCI-specific gait patterns, will see expanded use in future diagnostic research. Furthermore, early diagnosis and interventions for dementia, AD, and PD-three degenerative diseases closely tied to MCI progression-are anticipated to gain traction. These areas are likely to remain focal points in MCI gait studies. Concurrently, advancements in the validity and reliability of gait analysis are accelerating, with DT walking paradigms demonstrating notable utility and AI-driven diagnostic models enabling multidimensional gait parameter analysis. However, optimal task paradigms and diagnostic frameworks remain underexplored due to limited research. While exercise is widely recognized for improving cognitive and motor function in MCI, inconsistent evaluation criteria necessitate further multi-center studies to identify optimal physical activity regimens for MCI patients. In summary, this analysis fosters academic collaboration and provides a foundation for identifying research hotspots and emerging trends in MCI-related gait studies.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/683"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "b6489482-270b-4570-850b-18aef51e6b40"}
