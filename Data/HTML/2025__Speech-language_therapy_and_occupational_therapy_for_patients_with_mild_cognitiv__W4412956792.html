        <title>Speech-language therapy and occupational therapy for patients with mild cognitive impairment and dementia: a retrospective cohort study using German health claims data | BMC Health Services Research | Full Text</title>

        
    
    <meta name="citation_abstract" content="Dementia is a complex, multifactorial syndrome characterised by cognitive decline and impaired daily functioning, representing a major risk factor for long-term care dependency. As the prevalence of dementia will increase due to demographic change, healthcare systems face growing challenges, including timely diagnosis, equitable access to care, and managing the rising demand for health services. Speech-language therapy (SLT) and occupational therapy (OT) can help maintain cognitive function and quality of life, particularly in the early stages of dementia or mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, their utilisation in Germany remains poorly understood. This study evaluates the utilisation and prescription patterns of SLT and OT among people with dementia or MCI and explores factors associated with therapy use, based on German claims data. A retrospective cohort study was conducted using routinely collected data from the research database of the Institute for Applied Health Research Berlin (InGef), including anonymised health records of 5&#160;million individuals in Germany. The dataset covered the period from 2017 to 2022. Incident cases of dementia or MCI were tracked for two years following diagnosis to assess therapy use and prescription patterns. Different facets associated with therapy use were analysed using multivariable logistic regression. A total of 63,496 individuals (58% female, 42% male) were included (81.8% with dementia, 18.2% with MCI). Of these, 4.2% received SLT and 10.3% received OT (at least one prescription within the two-year follow-up period). Male sex (Odds Ratio [OR] 1.24, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.09&#8211;1.40) and certain dementia types were significantly associated with higher odds of receiving SLT compared to individuals with Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD): dementia classified elsewhere (OR 3.34, 95% CI 2.46&#8211;4.53), vascular dementia (OR 1.71, 95% CI: 1.36&#8211;2.15), and MCI (OR 1.61, 95% CI: 1.28&#8211;2.03). In contrast, these dementia types were associated with lower odds of receiving OT. Older age was negatively associated with SLT use, whereas no consistent age-related pattern was observed for OT utilisation. Our findings reveal low utilisation of SLT and OT, highlighting significant gaps in allied health service provision for people with dementia or MCI. These results underscore the need for improved referral pathways and targeted strategies to better integrate allied health professionals into routine dementia care. The study was not registered."/>

    <meta property="og:description" content="Background Dementia is a complex, multifactorial syndrome characterised by cognitive decline and impaired daily functioning, representing a major risk factor for long-term care dependency. As the prevalence of dementia will increase due to demographic change, healthcare systems face growing challenges, including timely diagnosis, equitable access to care, and managing the rising demand for health services. Speech-language therapy (SLT) and occupational therapy (OT) can help maintain cognitive function and quality of life, particularly in the early stages of dementia or mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, their utilisation in Germany remains poorly understood. Objective This study evaluates the utilisation and prescription patterns of SLT and OT among people with dementia or MCI and explores factors associated with therapy use, based on German claims data. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted using routinely collected data from the research database of the Institute for Applied Health Research Berlin (InGef), including anonymised health records of 5 million individuals in Germany. The dataset covered the period from 2017 to 2022. Incident cases of dementia or MCI were tracked for two years following diagnosis to assess therapy use and prescription patterns. Different facets associated with therapy use were analysed using multivariable logistic regression. Results A total of 63,496 individuals (58% female, 42% male) were included (81.8% with dementia, 18.2% with MCI). Of these, 4.2% received SLT and 10.3% received OT (at least one prescription within the two-year follow-up period). Male sex (Odds Ratio [OR] 1.24, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.09&#8211;1.40) and certain dementia types were significantly associated with higher odds of receiving SLT compared to individuals with Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD): dementia classified elsewhere (OR 3.34, 95% CI 2.46&#8211;4.53), vascular dementia (OR 1.71, 95% CI: 1.36&#8211;2.15), and MCI (OR 1.61, 95% CI: 1.28&#8211;2.03). In contrast, these dementia types were associated with lower odds of receiving OT. Older age was negatively associated with SLT use, whereas no consistent age-related pattern was observed for OT utilisation. Conclusion Our findings reveal low utilisation of SLT and OT, highlighting significant gaps in allied health service provision for people with dementia or MCI. These results underscore the need for improved referral pathways and targeted strategies to better integrate allied health professionals into routine dementia care. Trial registration The study was not registered."/>

As the prevalence of dementia will increase due to demographic change, healthcare systems face growing challenges, including timely diagnosis, equitable access to care, and managing the rising demand for health services. Speech-language therapy (SLT) and occupational therapy (OT) can help maintain cognitive function and quality of life, particularly in the early stages of dementia or mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, their utilisation in Germany remains poorly understood.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Objective</h3><p>This study evaluates the utilisation and prescription patterns of SLT and OT among people with dementia or MCI and explores factors associated with therapy use, based on German claims data.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Methods</h3><p>A retrospective cohort study was conducted using routinely collected data from the research database of the Institute for Applied Health Research Berlin (InGef), including anonymised health records of 5 million individuals in Germany. The dataset covered the period from 2017 to 2022. Incident cases of dementia or MCI were tracked for two years following diagnosis to assess therapy use and prescription patterns. Different facets associated with therapy use were analysed using multivariable logistic regression.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Results</h3><p>A total of 63,496 individuals (58% female, 42% male) were included (81.8% with dementia, 18.2% with MCI). Of these, 4.2% received SLT and 10.3% received OT (at least one prescription within the two-year follow-up period).</p><p>Male sex (Odds Ratio [OR] 1.24, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.09–1.40) and certain dementia types were significantly associated with higher odds of receiving SLT compared to individuals with Alzheimer’s disease (AD): dementia classified elsewhere (OR 3.34, 95% CI 2.46–4.53), vascular dementia (OR 1.71, 95% CI: 1.36–2.15), and MCI (OR 1.61, 95% CI: 1.28–2.03). In contrast, these dementia types were associated with lower odds of receiving OT. Older age was negatively associated with SLT use, whereas no consistent age-related pattern was observed for OT utilisation.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Conclusion</h3><p>Our findings reveal low utilisation of SLT and OT, highlighting significant gaps in allied health service provision for people with dementia or MCI. These results underscore the need for improved referral pathways and targeted strategies to better integrate allied health professionals into routine dementia care.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Trial registration</h3><p>The study was not registered.</p></div></div></section>

These individuals are insured with one of over 60 statutory health insurance (SHI) funds, primarily company or guild-based insurance funds. Claims data can be traced back over a period of six years. For this analysis, an age- and sex representative sample of approximately 5 million individuals from 2017 to 2022 was selected. The database included socio-demographic data such as age, sex and region of residence, as well as diagnoses from outpatient and inpatient sectors. It also contained information on healthcare services and procedures, reimbursed non-pharmacological therapies, medical aids, and pharmaceuticals. Each diagnosis or treatment included information on the profession of the treating physician. Diagnoses were coded according to the German Modification of the international Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (ICD-10-GM). Non-pharmacological therapies were documented by corresponding therapeutic appliance item numbers according to the specifications of the German Catalogue of Therapeutic Appliances. All patient-level data were de-identified in compliance with German Data Protection Regulation (§ 67 Abs. 2 SGB X i.V.m. Art. 4 Nr. 1 DSGVO), and the use of the database for health services research was fully compliant with German federal law. Subsequently, ethical approval was not required for this study.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec5">Population</h3><p>Adult patients aged 18 years and older were included in the study population if they were continuously insured with one of the SHI organisations included in the InGef database during the observation period or until death. This criterion ensured the availability of complete claims data, independent of healthcare utilisation frequency. Analyses of patient characteristics and therapy utilisation were conducted in the subpopulation with a newly confirmed diagnosis of dementia or MCI. Only psychiatric diagnoses from Chapter V of the ICD-10-GM indicating clinically manifest dementia or MCI were considered: F00.-* (Dementia in AD), F01.-* (vascular dementia), F02.-* (dementia in other diseases classified elsewhere), F03 (unspecified dementia), and F06.7 (MCI). The code F02 refers to dementia as a consequence of other diseases classified elsewhere in the ICD-10-GM system, such as Parkinson’s disease or Pick’s disease. The code unspecified dementia is used when clinical criteria for dementia are met, but no specific etiology can yet be established, unlike F00–F02, which reflect defined underlying causes.</p><p>Diagnoses had to be documented either in outpatient care or as a main or secondary hospital discharge diagnosis. An outpatient diagnosis was considered confirmed if it was documented in two separate quarters in the index year (year of the initial diagnosis) or by two different physicians in the same quarter. To determine the incidence, a disease-free period of one year prior to the initial diagnosis was required. Incident cases from 2017 onwards were identified by using 2016 as a validation period. Patients firstly diagnosed with MCI or any form of dementia between 1 January 2017 and 31 December 2020 who could be followed for two years or until death were included (patient-individual period). An incident case entered the study population at the beginning of the quarter in which the dementia/MCI diagnosis was first documented. Study exit was defined as the end of the observation period or death. There were no exclusion criteria.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec6">Measures</h3><p>The primary outcome was the use of SLT and OT by PWD/MCI. According to the German Catalogue of Therapeutic Services, these services must be prescribed by physicians to be reimbursed by the health insurers related to different indication codes. These codes also indicate the medical reason for the treatment. However, these codes often cover a wide range of conditions and do not provide information about the exact underlying disease. For this reason, the study linked the ICD diagnosis data to the use of SLT and OT on an individual basis.</p><p>The first step of the analysis assessed the overall proportion of patients who received SLT or OT, regardless of the indication. The second step examined whether these patients were being specifically treated concerning their diagnosis of dementia/MCI. In the case of SLT, a distinction was made between therapy for cognitive communication impairments (indication code: SP5) and therapy for dysphagia (indication code: SC), as these are dementia-related interventions. As both indications can be prescribed for different neurological conditions, physicians have the option to voluntarily document up to four ICD codes relevant to treatment on the prescription. These were also checked to see if a dementia/MCI diagnosis was recorded (dementia-specification of the prescription). OT already has a dementia-specific code (PS5 until 12/2020, PS4 since 1/2021) that allowed billing for cognitive training or psycho-functional treatment [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 12" title="Gemeinsamer Bundesausschuss (G-BA).

In the following, we refer to OT prescriptions using this code as “dementia- specific OT”. Different services may be ordered per prescription (e.g. 30 min of individual SLT or OT cognitive training). SLT prescriptions typically cover 10–20 therapy sessions, and OT prescription 10 sessions. A home visit could be added to any prescription. Group therapy was available for both SLT, focusing on communication, and for OT, focusing on dementia- specific interventions [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 12" title="Gemeinsamer Bundesausschuss (G-BA).

Definitions and codes of all variables used are provided in the Supplementary Material (Table S2). Patients who received at least one prescription during the follow-up period were considered to be patients who received treatment. Additionally, the number of prescriptions per patient and the number of therapy sessions billed were quantified. For each prescription, the professional subject of the prescribing physician was identified. The regularity of therapy provision was also assessed. Regular care was defined as having at least one prescription in at least three of the eight quarters of follow-up. With regard to socio-demographic factors, age and sex were examined. Age was calculated in the quarter of the initial diagnosis and patients were grouped into age categories ranging from: 18–64, 65–69, 70–74, 75–79, 80–84, 85–89, ≥ 90 years. Clinical variables included the type of dementia and the clinical discipline of the prescribing physician.

Men were more likely than women to receive SLT for both communication (OR1.24, 95% CI 1.09–1.40) and dysphagia (OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.35–1.73). Regarding dementia type, individuals diagnosed with dementia classified elsewhere had substantially higher odds of receiving SLT– more than three times higher for communication therapy (OR 3.34, 95% CI 2.46–4.53) and over four times higher for dysphagia therapy (OR 4.12, 95% CI 3.04–5.55) compared to patients with AD. Vascular dementia was also significantly associated with higher SLT use (communication: OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.36–2.15; dysphagia: OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.47–2.36). MCI was associated with higher SLT use only for communication (OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.28–2.03), but not for dysphagia. This indicated that certain dementia types were significantly more likely to receive SLT compared to AD.</p><p>Age showed a consistent negative association: compared with those aged 18–64, all older groups had progressively lower odds of receiving SLT. Detailed trends are shown in Figures <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s12913-025-13149-y#MOESM1">S1</a> and <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s12913-025-13149-y#MOESM1">S2</a> (Supplementary Material).</p><p>In contrast, the use of OT followed a different pattern. Higher odds were observed in the 65–69 (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.18–1.81) and 75–79 (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.14–1.60) age groups, but there was no consistent trend across age groups. In particular, people aged ≥ 85 years were less likely to receive OT than younger groups. In contrast to SLT, there were no significant sex differences in OT use. Dementia type again played a role: vascular dementia (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.34–0.44), dementia classified elsewhere (OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.18–0.35), unspecified dementia and MCI were all associated with significantly lower odds of OT use compared to AD.

According to a survey of <i>n</i> = 276 PWD in Germany, the median time between first symptoms and formal diagnosis was 16 months [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 45" title="Wolff F, Dietzel N, Karrer L, Kratzer A, Hess M, Gräßel E, et al.

This indicates that the treatment of individuals with MCI is already part of current clinical practice. However, this level of care provision should be further developed and standardised to ensure earlier and more consistent support for this patient group. The majority of people with MCI in our sample received SLT for communication impairments, and logistic regression confirmed a positive association between MCI and SLT utilisation. This is particularly notable, as language and communication disorders are strong predictors of the progression from MCI to dementia [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 17" title="McCullough KC, Bayles KA, Bouldin ED.

This level of visibility and professional recognition has yet to be established in the German context.</p><p>Our findings also indicate that SLTs were only marginally involved in the treatment of dysphagia among PWD. Given that the German S3 guideline explicitly mandates SLT involvement in swallowing therapy [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 5" title="DGN e.

One possible explanation is that dysphagia typically occurs in later stages of dementia and may not have been captured during the two-year follow-up period. Additionally, it is likely that the small number of patients with MCI who received dysphagia therapy were treated for comorbid conditions such as stroke or Parkinson’s disease, rather than for dementia-related symptoms.</p><p>In general, SLT utilisation must be interpreted in the context of the underlying data structure. Unlike OT, it is not possible to reliably determine from the available data whether SLT was prescribed for dementia/MCI or for other comorbid conditions. Since treatment-relevant diagnoses are not required on prescriptions, our findings may overestimate dementia-specific SLT use. This interpretation is further supported by the logistic regression results, which showed significantly higher odds of receiving SLT among patients with vascular dementia and dementia associated with other neurological diseases compared to those with AD. This suggests that SLT was often prescribed to address comorbidities rather than dementia symptoms. Its established use in conditions such as stroke and Parkinson’s disease may explain the more frequent application in these dementia subtypes. In contrast, OT was less frequently prescribed for non-AD patients, possibly reflecting its stronger emphasis in clinical research and treatment guidelines for AD compared to other dementia types [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 22" title="Smallfield S, Metzger L, Green M, Henley L, Rhodus EK.

These factors can be systematised using Andersen’s behavioural model of health services utilisation, which distinguishes between three core components: predisposing characteristics, enabling resources, and individual need.

These findings may reflect sex-based differences in referral patterns or help-seeking behaviour. It is also plausible that women, as primary caregivers, are more actively involved in organising healthcare and therapy services—potentially leading to higher therapy uptake among male patients [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 52" title="Poisson VO, Poulos RG, Withall AL, Reilly A, Emerson L, O’Connor CMC.

One commonly assumed explanation is the perception of financial restrictions. While AHP services are generally subject to budgetary limits in Germany, dementia is classified as a special prescription need, which exempts these therapies from standard cost-effectiveness evaluations [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 58" title="Kassenärztliche Bundesvereinigung KBV.

This indicates the need for improved education, training programmes and clear guidelines to support therapists in practice.

One promising approach is group therapy, which allows a single therapist to treat several patients simultaneously. Despite its potential, group-based cognitive interventions such as CST remain underutilised in practice. This finding highlights the need for further research into barriers to implementation and the development of strategies to increase uptake. Additional research is also needed to evaluate the optimal duration, intensity, and cost-effectiveness of cognitive interventions for PWD/MCI in real-world care settings. Given that our findings indicate a median of 34–60 sessions per patient over two years, this may serve as a feasible benchmark for routine care. Cognitive interventions that also aim to reduce carer burden - as well as communication or educational training in a group setting - offer further potential [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 62" title="Eggenberger E, Heimerl K, Bennett MI.

The use of routine data reduces the risk of bias due to non-response, recall or selection bias. Moreover, secondary data allow the inclusion of multimorbid and institutionalised individuals, who are often excluded from primary surveys.

They reflect diagnostic and prescribing behaviour rather than actual disease prevalence or clinical needs and are subject to limitations regarding data quality and validity. This is particularly relevant in the context of diagnosing MCI, dementia, and its subtypes, as dementia diagnoses in claims data are not standardised and do not correspond to prospective clinical assessments. In outpatient care, misclassifications and the frequent use of unspecific diagnoses are common, as also reflected in our analysis. Furthermore, the diagnosis of MCI is used heterogeneously in clinical practice and may represent a wide range of underlying conditions [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 5" title="DGN e.

Additionally, it was not possible to determine whether patients who received SLT or OT had previously undergone similar treatment prior to their dementia or MCI diagnosis. Therefore, the entire analysis must be interpreted in the context of possible confounding by other diseases.

For a more accurate analysis, co-morbidities should have been included.</p><p>Another key limitation relates to the specificity of treatment indications. Due to structural limitations in the German billing system, it was not always possible to determine whether SLT was prescribed for dementia-related symptoms or for other neurological conditions. This ambiguity may have led to an overestimation of dementia-specific SLT use. Furthermore, the data solely captures treatments billed to the SHIs, not those services that were excluded from reimbursement. Prescriptions from self-pay patients could not be included. Patients with private health insurance were excluded from the dataset, which may limit generalisability of the findings to the entire population.</p></div></div></section><section data-title="Conclusion"><div class="c-article-section" id="Sec18-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="Sec18">Conclusion</h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec18-content"><p>SLT and OT are valuable resources in non-pharmacological dementia care. This study is the first comprehensive analysis of SLT and OT utilisation among PWD/MCI in Germany using nationwide health claims data. Our findings show that these services remain underutilised in routine care. The low uptake of SLT and OT, particularly among people with MCI, suggests missed opportunities for early intervention. The disparities observed in utilisation according to sex, age, and dementia type may reflect barriers to access and referral. Further research is needed to explore these disparities and develop targeted strategies to improve care pathways and integrate SLT and OT more effectively into routine dementia care.</p></div></div></section>
