        <title>A comprehensive review on novel opportunities for Alzheimer therapy by targeting BIN1 | Egyptian Journal of Medical Human Genetics | Full Text</title>

        
    
    <meta name="citation_abstract" content="Alzheimer&#8217;s disease is a neurological disease marked by memory loss, cognitive decline, and behavioral abnormalities. The major frequent cause of dementia is AD, with an estimated 50&#160;million or more individuals affected globally, these days. Several conventional susceptibility genes have been found in preliminary research, such as the Amyloid Precursor Protein, Apolipoprotein E (APOE) for late onset AD (LOAD), Presenilin genes 1 and 2 for early onset AD (EOAD). In this review paper we highlight the effect of BIN1 in AD. A total of 110 articles were retrieved from Google Scholar, PubMed and ScienceDirect using various keywords. After full-text evaluation and applying the literature selection criteria, 98 articles were selected in the review. Only studies published in English, covering the human, animal or in vitro aspects of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease are included in this list. Articles that were not written in English, treated other topics, were not examining BIN1 or Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, were abstracts from conferences, editorials, letters, short papers with missing data or repeated studies were all excluded. From the initial screening, applying the right criteria resulted in 98 articles being chosen for this review to explore and understand BIN1&#8217;s connection to Alzheimer&#8217;s disease. Research revealed a significant locus of susceptibility for LOAD on the Bridging Integrator 1 (BIN1) that is situated on chromosome 2q14.3 and is identified at the time of the most significant susceptibility gene of LOAD. Neuronal circuits connected synaptically are the medium via which tau disease spread, yet the fundamental mechanisms remain unknown. BIN1&#8212;amphiphysin 2 is most common genetic risk factor for late onset AD. In brain illness, the neuronal isoform of BIN1-amphiphysin 2 is downregulated. BIN1, or amphiphysin II, is a Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) domain containing protein that controls membrane curvature and participates in clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Changes in BIN1 expression levels have been shown to impair endocytic flux, likely due to problems with vesicle scission and trafficking. Additionally, preventing endocytosis by blocking dyamin also lowers Tau pathology propagation. The cytoplasmic membrane binding protein BIN1 is involved in subcellular trafficking and endocytosis. The most frequent BIN1 variants are found in non-coding regions immediately upstream of the gene, and it is thus likely that their impact is regulatory and not structural. The variants can influence the levels of BIN1 or splicing between isoforms, especially the distribution of isoforms. In AD, there is a significant change in expression of BIN1 isoforms, where there is an upregulation of shorter glial-specific isoforms and a downregulation of longer neuronal isoforms. Such isoform imbalance can interfere with neuronal function and play a role in AD pathogenesis, making it essential to target BIN1 splicing regulation as a therapeutic modality.

    <meta property="og:title" content="A comprehensive review on novel opportunities for Alzheimer therapy by targeting BIN1 - Egyptian Journal of Medical Human Genetics"/>
    <meta property="og:description" content="Background Alzheimer&#8217;s disease is a neurological disease marked by memory loss, cognitive decline, and behavioral abnormalities. The major frequent cause of dementia is AD, with an estimated 50 million or more individuals affected globally, these days. Several conventional susceptibility genes have been found in preliminary research, such as the Amyloid Precursor Protein, Apolipoprotein E (APOE) for late onset AD (LOAD), Presenilin genes 1 and 2 for early onset AD (EOAD). Objective In this review paper we highlight the effect of BIN1 in AD. Method of study A total of 110 articles were retrieved from Google Scholar, PubMed and ScienceDirect using various keywords. After full-text evaluation and applying the literature selection criteria, 98 articles were selected in the review. Only studies published in English, covering the human, animal or in vitro aspects of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease are included in this list. Articles that were not written in English, treated other topics, were not examining BIN1 or Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, were abstracts from conferences, editorials, letters, short papers with missing data or repeated studies were all excluded. From the initial screening, applying the right criteria resulted in 98 articles being chosen for this review to explore and understand BIN1&#8217;s connection to Alzheimer&#8217;s disease. Results Research revealed a significant locus of susceptibility for LOAD on the Bridging Integrator 1 (BIN1) that is situated on chromosome 2q14.3 and is identified at the time of the most significant susceptibility gene of LOAD. Neuronal circuits connected synaptically are the medium via which tau disease spread, yet the fundamental mechanisms remain unknown. BIN1&#8212;amphiphysin 2 is most common genetic risk factor for late onset AD. In brain illness, the neuronal isoform of BIN1-amphiphysin 2 is downregulated. BIN1, or amphiphysin II, is a Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) domain containing protein that controls membrane curvature and participates in clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Changes in BIN1 expression levels have been shown to impair endocytic flux, likely due to problems with vesicle scission and trafficking. Additionally, preventing endocytosis by blocking dyamin also lowers Tau pathology propagation. The cytoplasmic membrane binding protein BIN1 is involved in subcellular trafficking and endocytosis. Conclusion The most frequent BIN1 variants are found in non-coding regions immediately upstream of the gene, and it is thus likely that their impact is regulatory and not structural. The variants can influence the levels of BIN1 or splicing between isoforms, especially the distribution of isoforms. In AD, there is a significant change in expression of BIN1 isoforms, where there is an upregulation of shorter glial-specific isoforms and a downregulation of longer neuronal isoforms. Such isoform imbalance can interfere with neuronal function and play a role in AD pathogenesis, making it essential to target BIN1 splicing regulation as a therapeutic modality. Graphical abstract"/>

Research revealed a significant locus of susceptibility for LOAD on the Bridging Integrator 1 (BIN1) that is situated on chromosome 2q14.3 and is identified at the time of the most significant susceptibility gene of LOAD. Neuronal circuits connected synaptically are the medium via which tau disease spread, yet the fundamental mechanisms remain unknown. BIN1—amphiphysin 2 is most common genetic risk factor for late onset AD. In brain illness, the neuronal isoform of BIN1-amphiphysin 2 is downregulated. BIN1, or amphiphysin II, is a Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) domain containing protein that controls membrane curvature and participates in clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Changes in BIN1 expression levels have been shown to impair endocytic flux, likely due to problems with vesicle scission and trafficking. Additionally, preventing endocytosis by blocking dyamin also lowers Tau pathology propagation. The cytoplasmic membrane binding protein BIN1 is involved in subcellular trafficking and endocytosis. The most frequent BIN1 variants are found in non-coding regions immediately upstream of the gene, and it is thus likely that their impact is regulatory and not structural. The variants can influence the levels of BIN1 or splicing between isoforms, especially the distribution of isoforms. In AD, there is a significant change in expression of BIN1 isoforms, where there is an upregulation of shorter glial-specific isoforms and a downregulation of longer neuronal isoforms. Such isoform imbalance can interfere with neuronal function and play a role in AD pathogenesis, making it essential to target BIN1 splicing regulation as a therapeutic modality. \n\n                  \n                    \n                  \n                ","datePublished":"2025-08-07T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2025-08-07T00:00:00Z","pageStart":"1","pageEnd":"9","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","sameAs":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s43042-025-00759-8","keywords":["Alzheimer disease","\n                        BIN1\n                     ","LOAD","APOE","Neuronal isoform","Tau pathology","Medicine/Public Health","general"],"image":["https://media.springernature.com/lw1200/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fs43042-025-00759-8/MediaObjects/43042_2025_759_Figa_HTML.png","https://media.springernature.com/lw1200/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fs43042-025-00759-8/MediaObjects/43042_2025_759_Fig1_HTML.png","https://media.springernature.com/lw1200/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fs43042-025-00759-8/MediaObjects/43042_2025_759_Fig2_HTML.png"],"isPartOf":{"name":"Egyptian Journal of Medical Human Genetics","issn":["2090-2441"],"volumeNumber":"26","@type":["Periodical","PublicationVolume"]},"publisher":{"name":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","logo":{"url":"https://www.springernature.com/app-sn/public/images/logo-springernature.png","@type":"ImageObject"},"@type":"Organization"},"author":[{"name":"Trina Saha","affiliation":[{"name":"Techno India University, West Bengal","address":{"name":"Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, Techno India University, West Bengal, Kolkata, India","@type":"PostalAddress"},"@type":"Organization"}],"@type":"Person"},{"name":"Dipanjan Karati","url":"http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0734-6015","affiliation":[{"name":"Techno India University, West Bengal","address":{"name":"Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, Techno India University, West Bengal, Kolkata, India","@type":"PostalAddress"},"@type":"Organization"}],"email":"karatibabai@gmail.com","@type":"Person"}],"isAccessibleForFree":true,"@type":"ScholarlyArticle"},"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"WebPage"}</script>

The major frequent cause of dementia is AD, with an estimated 50 million or more individuals affected globally, these days. Several conventional susceptibility genes have been found in preliminary research, such as the Amyloid Precursor Protein, Apolipoprotein E (APOE) for late onset AD (LOAD), Presenilin genes 1 and 2 for early onset AD (EOAD).</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Objective</h3><p>In this review paper we highlight the effect of <i>BIN1</i> in AD.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Method of study</h3><p>A total of 110 articles were retrieved from Google Scholar, PubMed and ScienceDirect using various keywords. After full-text evaluation and applying the literature selection criteria, 98 articles were selected in the review. Only studies published in English, covering the human, animal or in vitro aspects of Alzheimer’s disease are included in this list. Articles that were not written in English, treated other topics, were not examining BIN1 or Alzheimer’s disease, were abstracts from conferences, editorials, letters, short papers with missing data or repeated studies were all excluded. From the initial screening, applying the right criteria resulted in 98 articles being chosen for this review to explore and understand BIN1’s connection to Alzheimer’s disease.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Results</h3><p>Research revealed a significant locus of susceptibility for LOAD on the Bridging Integrator 1 (<i>BIN1</i>) that is situated on chromosome 2q14.3 and is identified at the time of the most significant susceptibility gene of LOAD. Neuronal circuits connected synaptically are the medium via which tau disease spread, yet the fundamental mechanisms remain unknown. <i>BIN1</i>—amphiphysin 2 is most common genetic risk factor for late onset AD. In brain illness, the neuronal isoform of <i>BIN1</i>-amphiphysin 2 is downregulated. BIN1, or amphiphysin II, is a Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) domain containing protein that controls membrane curvature and participates in clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Changes in BIN1 expression levels have been shown to impair endocytic flux, likely due to problems with vesicle scission and trafficking. Additionally, preventing endocytosis by blocking dyamin also lowers Tau pathology propagation. The cytoplasmic membrane binding protein <i>BIN1</i> is involved in subcellular trafficking and endocytosis.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Conclusion</h3><p>The most frequent BIN1 variants are found in non-coding regions immediately upstream of the gene, and it is thus likely that their impact is regulatory and not structural. The variants can influence the levels of BIN1 or splicing between isoforms, especially the distribution of isoforms. In AD, there is a significant change in expression of BIN1 isoforms, where there is an upregulation of shorter glial-specific isoforms and a downregulation of longer neuronal isoforms. Such isoform imbalance can interfere with neuronal function and play a role in AD pathogenesis, making it essential to target BIN1 splicing regulation as a therapeutic modality.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Graphical abstract</h3>

These findings imply that <i>BIN1</i> plays a probable modulatory role in tangle pathology in AD and that this function may be carried out in other human diseases that exhibit tau pathology. NFT is the major primary pathological characteristics in AD. Tau, a protein associated with microtubules, may regulate the consistency of microtubules in neurons; however, when tau undergoes aberrant modification, it separates from microtubules and causes pathological lesions. According to current research, aberrantly phosphorylated tau (p-tau) manifests comparatively early in brain development, and the particular p-tau confirmation has been linked to the pathophysiology of AD [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 69" title="Braak H, Del Tredici K (2011) The pathological process underlying Alzheimer’s disease in individuals under thirty.

In comparison with controls, tau phosphorylated at S396/S404 was observed to build up at the synapses in both moderate and several phases of AD. The loss of cytoplasmic tau was accompanied by an accumulation of synaptic tau, indicating that reflect tau was missorted from the cytoplasm to the synapses. In both severe and moderate AD tissues, we discovered notable and substantial losses of cytoplasmic <i>BIN1</i>, which correlated inversely with increases in synaptic tau and positively with decreases in cytoplasmic tau. Additionally, it has been discovered that the phosphorylated (pSer396/404, PHF 1) <i>BIN1</i> and tau levels in the cytoplasmic fraction correlated negatively. Additionally, there was no discernible relationship between the amounts of <i>BIN1</i> in the total or synaptoneurosome fractions and either total or phosphorylated tau. The synapse’s phosphorylated tau missorting could be aided by the loss of cytoplasmic <i>BIN1</i>. Since tau is linked to <i>BIN1</i>, we reasoned that reducing <i>BIN1</i> protein levels would also reduce Tau. Phosphorylated Tau (pTau) levels in the HEK 239T rex cells did not drop following IgG treatment. <i>BIN1</i> mAb, decrease the levels of pTau and <i>BIN1</i>. <i>BIN1</i> and Tau have been shown to interact directly in numerous studies [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 30" title="Chapuis J, Hansmannel F, Gistelinck M, Mounier A, Van Cauwenberghe C, Kolen KV et al (2013) Increasd expression of BIN1 mediates Alzheimer genetic risk by modulating tau pathology.

The main way that BIN1 influences the risk of AD is through altering tau pathology. Aptosis, calcium homeostasis, and endocytosis/trafficking also impact cellular processes. Epigenetic changes significantly influence the pathogenesis of AD. Our discovery that the BIN1 promoter was methylated was linked to early pathological alterations in preclinical AD. This finding is in line with earlier research on brain tissue that demonstrated the relationship between tau tangle density and Aβ-load and methylation in BIN1.</p><p>Furthermore, research on the relationship between AD pathology and BIN1 protein has confirmed that BIN1 plays a role in the early pathological alterations of AD. Regarding Aβ-related pathology specifically, it was previously believed that the BIN1 protein participates in the endocytosis, which may act as a pathway leading to the creation and distribution of APP. One trait linked to AD amyloid pathology was the abnormal build-up of BIN1 protein. Regarding tau-related pathology, it has been observed that elevated expression of the BIN1 protein intensifies tau-related pathology by directly binding to a proline-rich domain in tau through the SH3 domain, in addition to altering the endocytosis of tau protein. The BIN1 protein also modulates actin dynamics connected to tau. The BIN1 protein played a role in the pathological alterations associated with AD, as well as the way in which it impacted tau pathology and Aβ pathology. Because of BIN1’s possible role in the pathophysiology of AD, targeting BIN1 may offer new avenues for treating AD.</p><p>In order to further promote the understanding and therapeutic application of BIN1 in AD, a number of critical areas should be targeted for intense exploration. Molecular studies should seek to elucidate the specific mechanisms by which BIN1 acts on Tau pathology, endocytosis, and cytoskeletal dynamics—using methods such as CRISPR-mediated gene editing, isoform-specific knockdown/overexpression models, and high-resolution protein interaction mapping. It is also necessary to explore BIN1’s alternative splicing regulation, explicitly the upstream non-coding variants that potentially influence isoform expression in a cell-type specific fashion. Interventions therapeutically could involve the design of antisense oligonucleotides or small molecules to manipulate BIN1 splicing, reconstitute neuronal isoform expression, or interfere with BIN1-Tau interactions.</p></div></div></section>
