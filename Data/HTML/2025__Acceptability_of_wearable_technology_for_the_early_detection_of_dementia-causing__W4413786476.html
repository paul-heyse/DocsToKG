        <title>Acceptability of wearable technology for the early detection of dementia-causing diseases: perspectives from the CODEC II cohort | BMC Digital Health | Full Text</title>

        
    
    <meta name="citation_abstract" content="The global prevalence of dementia is increasing exponentially. Early detection of dementia-causing diseases could support therapeutic intervention to decelerate disease progression. Wearable digital technologies can be used to identify early signs of such diseases and remotely monitor disease progression. However, technologies must be acceptable to users. This study explored the perspectives of participants on the acceptability of various wearable technologies for early detection. Participants from the Cognitive Decline using Digital Devices (CODEC-II) cohort used four different wearables (smartwatch, electroencephalographic [EEG] headband, active and passive smartphone apps) for two weeks every three months over a year. A subgroup participated in semi structured interviews after two weeks to discuss their experiences and acceptance of the devices. Data was analysed using the framework analysis approach, aided by N-Vivo (v14.23.2). Twenty-one participants were interviewed, including individuals with subjective cognitive decline (n&#8201;=&#8201;10), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (n&#8201;=&#8201;7), dementia with Lewy bodies (n&#8201;=&#8201;1), and three caregivers. Five key themes were identified, including ease of use, wearability, usefulness, transparency, and behavioral intention. Many participants relied on the research team to help set up the technology for them due to high levels of digital anxiety. Individuals with MCI particularly struggled with cognitive testing games in the active smartphone app, which they experienced increased awareness of their own cognitive impairments. Participants preferred wrist-worn over head-worn devices due to familiarity and impact on their appearance. While some participants enjoyed using the wearables, others questioned their accuracy for medical purposes. There was also a lack of understanding around what data were being collected from the wearables and how it was being collected, with some expressing concerns about data disclosure. Participants with professional or caregiving responsibilities described how their busy lifestyles hindered daily use of the wearables. These findings highlight the importance of using an inclusive design approach to meet users&#8217; needs and support digital inclusivity, and an effective communication strategy to increase transparency and reduce data disclosure concerns. Future research is needed to explore the effectiveness of implementing current recommendations to support digital health equity and codesign a communication strategy with users to ensure the information is understandable. CODEC-II was retrospectively registered as a clinical trial under the registry ClinicalTrials.gov (trial registration number: NCT07051408, date of registration: 3rd June 2025)."/>

Early detection of dementia-causing diseases could support therapeutic intervention to decelerate disease progression. Wearable digital technologies can be used to identify early signs of such diseases and remotely monitor disease progression. However, technologies must be acceptable to users. This study explored the perspectives of participants on the acceptability of various wearable technologies for early detection. Participants from the Cognitive Decline using Digital Devices (CODEC-II) cohort used four different wearables (smartwatch, electroencephalographic [EEG] headband, active and passive smartphone apps) for two weeks every three months over a year. A subgroup participated in semi structured interviews after two weeks to discuss their experiences and acceptance of the devices. Data was analysed using the framework analysis approach, aided by N-Vivo (v14.23.2). Twenty-one participants were interviewed, including individuals with subjective cognitive decline (n = 10), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (n = 7), dementia with Lewy bodies (n = 1), and three caregivers. Five key themes were identified, including ease of use, wearability, usefulness, transparency, and behavioral intention. Many participants relied on the research team to help set up the technology for them due to high levels of digital anxiety. Individuals with MCI particularly struggled with cognitive testing games in the active smartphone app, which they experienced increased awareness of their own cognitive impairments. Participants preferred wrist-worn over head-worn devices due to familiarity and impact on their appearance. While some participants enjoyed using the wearables, others questioned their accuracy for medical purposes. There was also a lack of understanding around what data were being collected from the wearables and how it was being collected, with some expressing concerns about data disclosure. Participants with professional or caregiving responsibilities described how their busy lifestyles hindered daily use of the wearables. These findings highlight the importance of using an inclusive design approach to meet users’ needs and support digital inclusivity, and an effective communication strategy to increase transparency and reduce data disclosure concerns. Future research is needed to explore the effectiveness of implementing current recommendations to support digital health equity and codesign a communication strategy with users to ensure the information is understandable. CODEC-II was retrospectively registered as a clinical trial under the registry ClinicalTrials.gov (trial registration number: NCT07051408, date of registration: 3rd June 2025).","datePublished":"2025-08-29T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2025-08-29T00:00:00Z","pageStart":"1","pageEnd":"14","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","sameAs":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s44247-025-00191-3","keywords":["Qualitative","Dementia","Early detection","Digital health technologies","Wearable technologies","Health Informatics"],"image":["https://media.springernature.com/lw1200/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fs44247-025-00191-3/MediaObjects/44247_2025_191_Fig1_HTML.png","https://media.springernature.com/lw1200/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fs44247-025-00191-3/MediaObjects/44247_2025_191_Fig2_HTML.png","https://media.springernature.com/lw1200/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fs44247-025-00191-3/MediaObjects/44247_2025_191_Fig3_HTML.png","https://media.springernature.com/lw1200/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fs44247-025-00191-3/MediaObjects/44247_2025_191_Fig4_HTML.png"],"isPartOf":{"name":"BMC Digital Health","issn":["2731-684X"],"volumeNumber":"3","@type":["Periodical","PublicationVolume"]},"publisher":{"name":"BioMed Central","logo":{"url":"https://www.springernature.com/app-sn/public/images/logo-springernature.png","@type":"ImageObject"},"@type":"Organization"},"author":[{"name":"Sarah Wilson","affiliation":[{"name":"Newcastle University","address":{"name":"School of Pharmacy, Newcastle University, Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK","@type":"PostalAddress"},"@type":"Organization"}],"@type":"Person"},{"name":"Emily Beswick","affiliation":[{"name":"Trinity College Dublin","address":{"name":"Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland","@type":"PostalAddress"},"@type":"Organization"}],"@type":"Person"},{"name":"Rachel Morrell","affiliation":[{"name":"University College London","address":{"name":"University College London, London, UK","@type":"PostalAddress"},"@type":"Organization"},{"name":"Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust","address":{"name":"Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust, Essex, UK","@type":"PostalAddress"},"@type":"Organization"}],"@type":"Person"},{"name":"Sharandeep Bhogal","affiliation":[{"name":"University College London","address":{"name":"University College London, London, UK","@type":"PostalAddress"},"@type":"Organization"}],"@type":"Person"},{"name":"Clare Tolley","affiliation":[{"name":"Newcastle University","address":{"name":"School of Pharmacy, Newcastle University, Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK","@type":"PostalAddress"},"@type":"Organization"}],"@type":"Person"},{"name":"Tim Whitfield","affiliation":[{"name":"University College London","address":{"name":"University College London, London, UK","@type":"PostalAddress"},"@type":"Organization"}],"@type":"Person"},{"name":"Kieran Wing","affiliation":[{"name":"University College London","address":{"name":"University College London, London, UK","@type":"PostalAddress"},"@type":"Organization"}],"@type":"Person"},{"name":"Riona Mc Ardle","affiliation":[{"name":"Newcastle University","address":{"name":"Translational and Clinical Research Institute, Newcastle University, Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK","@type":"PostalAddress"},"@type":"Organization"}],"@type":"Person"},{"name":"Nehal Hassan","affiliation":[{"name":"Newcastle University","address":{"name":"School of Pharmacy, Newcastle University, Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK","@type":"PostalAddress"},"@type":"Organization"}],"@type":"Person"},{"name":"Zuzana Walker","affiliation":[{"name":"University College London","address":{"name":"University College London, London, UK","@type":"PostalAddress"},"@type":"Organization"},{"name":"Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust","address":{"name":"Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust, Essex, UK","@type":"PostalAddress"},"@type":"Organization"}],"@type":"Person"},{"name":"Sarah Slight","affiliation":[{"name":"Newcastle University","address":{"name":"School of Pharmacy, Newcastle University, Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK","@type":"PostalAddress"},"@type":"Organization"}],"email":"Sarah.Slight@newcastle.ac.uk","@type":"Person"}],"isAccessibleForFree":true,"@type":"ScholarlyArticle"},"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"WebPage"}</script>

                Background
                <p>The global prevalence of dementia is increasing exponentially. Early detection of dementia-causing diseases could support therapeutic intervention to decelerate disease progression. Wearable digital technologies can be used to identify early signs of such diseases and remotely monitor disease progression. However, technologies must be acceptable to users. This study explored the perspectives of participants on the acceptability of various wearable technologies for early detection.</p>
              
              <span class="unsupported-element u-hide">AbstractSection</span>
                Method
                <p>Participants from the Cognitive Decline using Digital Devices (CODEC-II) cohort used four different wearables (smartwatch, electroencephalographic [EEG] headband, active and passive smartphone apps) for two weeks every three months over a year. A subgroup participated in semi structured interviews after two weeks to discuss their experiences and acceptance of the devices. Data was analysed using the framework analysis approach, aided by N-Vivo (v14.23.2).</p>
              
              <span class="unsupported-element u-hide">AbstractSection</span>
                Results
                <p>Twenty-one participants were interviewed, including individuals with subjective cognitive decline (<i>n</i> = 10), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (<i>n</i> = 7), dementia with Lewy bodies (<i>n</i> = 1), and three caregivers. Five key themes were identified, including ease of use, wearability, usefulness, transparency, and behavioral intention. Many participants relied on the research team to help set up the technology for them due to high levels of digital anxiety. Individuals with MCI particularly struggled with cognitive testing games in the active smartphone app, which they experienced increased awareness of their own cognitive impairments. Participants preferred wrist-worn over head-worn devices due to familiarity and impact on their appearance. While some participants enjoyed using the wearables, others questioned their accuracy for medical purposes. There was also a lack of understanding around what data were being collected from the wearables and how it was being collected, with some expressing concerns about data disclosure. Participants with professional or caregiving responsibilities described how their busy lifestyles hindered daily use of the wearables.</p>
              
              <span class="unsupported-element u-hide">AbstractSection</span>
                Conclusion
                <p>These findings highlight the importance of using an inclusive design approach to meet users’ needs and support digital inclusivity, and an effective communication strategy to increase transparency and reduce data disclosure concerns. Future research is needed to explore the effectiveness of implementing current recommendations to support digital health equity and codesign a communication strategy with users to ensure the information is understandable.</p>

                Trial registration
                <p>CODEC-II was retrospectively registered as a clinical trial under the registry ClinicalTrials.gov (trial registration number: NCT07051408, date of registration: 3rd June 2025).</p>

They described how important it was to have the support of the research team with the initial onboarding process because <i>“when it [technology] doesn’t work, I don’t know what to do with it”</i> (P6, M, person with SCD), but <i>“once it’s up and running I’m all right”</i> (P13, F, caregiver). Another participant described how support at the onboarding stage provided reassurance that the technology was set up correctly; they would rather not “<i>fiddle with it [the technology], and then find out three days later it’s not working because I did something wrong</i>” (P2, F, person with SCD). Only a few participants were confident in using technology and described how they “<i>could probably have done it [set up the research study technologies] myself”</i> (P21, F, caregiver) without any support from the research team.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec17">Usability</h4><p>Many participants thought that the technologies could not be used effectively by those with visual impairments, hearing impairments, mobility issues, or living with cognitive decline. Some participants found the activity tracker screen hard to see when scrolling through the watch display, with one explaining how <i>“I can’t see unless I put my glasses on, and I haven’t bothered to put my glasses on</i>” (P24, F, person with SCD). Others found the headband audio recording “<i>very quiet. You have to almost have it to your ear to hear it</i>” (P21, F, caregiver). A caregiver described some concerns about the headband, explaining how her mum was “<i>quite weak, […] she can't hold things very well. […] trying to hold it [headband] in a position and concentrate on pressing the button is [was] hard for her”</i> (P21, F, caregiver). Participants with cognitive impairments struggled with the memory recall games within the active smartphone app, as they felt it increased their awareness of their decreased cognitive ability, which some found frustrating.</p><blockquote class="c-blockquote"><div class="c-blockquote__body">
                    <p>“<i>Brought it to the forefront that I am forgetting things, I am getting confused, […] when I was doing the tests at times, I was getting quite frustrated.”</i> (P3, M, living with MCI).</p>
                  </div></blockquote><p>Some compatibility issues between the research study technologies and the participants’ own devices appeared to emerge. Participants found pairing new wearables with their existing smartphones was difficult due to connectivity issues (e.g., lack of access to Wi-Fi); this was felt to have contributed to many participants stopping their use of the technology, as they perceived it “<i>a waste of time”</i> and a <i>“source of frustration because my life is very much on the go, I always have to make sure [that] the Wi-Fi at the place I’m at, is connected</i>” (P14, F, living with MCI). Other participants noticed that their phones were not compatible with all the games in the active smartphone app, particularly a game that required a gyroscope to detect tilting motion (unlikely to be included in older phone models).</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec18">Wearability</h3><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec19">Appearance</h4><p>Participants were conscious of their appearance when wearing the headband, particularly female participants, with one remarking how their “<i>husband just laughs, obviously every time I get into bed […] I’ve got my headset [headband] and he just looks at me and goes, night</i>” (P24, F, person with SCD). Some participants with long hair described how the headband <i>“makes my hair really flat. So, every night you sleep in it you’ve got to dampen your hair and blow dry and fluff it up a bit, which isn’t great […], it’s annoying.”</i> (P14, F, living with MCI).</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec20">Placement of the wearable &amp; comfort</h4><p>Many found the wrist-worn device (activity tracker) the most comfortable device to wear and appeared familiar with its use, describing it as “<i>basically a watch”</i> (P11, F, person with SCD). A small number reported irritation due to fastening the device too tightly or a possible allergic reaction to the strap material. Many participants felt that the headband was <i>“a bit strange the first night or so</i> […] <i>you’re just aware something’s there</i>” (P9, F, living with MCI). This unease appeared to make it harder for participants to sleep, with some removing the headband during the night. A few participants also reported waking up “<i>with a splitting headache”</i> (P8, M, person with SCD), which they attributed to <i>“just physically having something around your [their] head</i>” (P8, M, person with SCD). Some participants also felt that the instructions that they had to follow to use the headband were quite challenging:</p><blockquote class="c-blockquote"><div class="c-blockquote__body">
                    <p>“<i>These two little lugs [prongs on the headband to stabilize the band] at the back, they rather make your neck sore, and you’ve got to make sure there's no hair under them. That’s a nuisance because I could put a scarf round to keep the hair off, but that slips off</i>” (P2, F, person with SCD).</p>
                  </div></blockquote><p>Another participant struggled with placing the headband correctly on their head, describing how they wore the headband one night “<i>slightly lower […], when you lay on your ear, that hurts</i>” (P12, F, living with MCI). Another participant appeared to improvise by putting the headband “<i>over the top of everything”</i> (P3, M, living with MCI) to help ensure a tighter fit. However, participants also described becoming accustomed to wearing the headband over time but felt that two weeks was “<i>more than enough. I don’t think you could do any more than that. […] I’ll be glad to get this off and have a proper night’s sleep</i>” (P10, F, person with SCD).</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec21">Usefulness</h3><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec22">Self-monitoring</h4><p>The push notifications (set as a manufacture default on the activity tracker) were designed to encourage users to be more physically active and were well liked by some. One participant described how this functionality was <i>“good for me, […] to give me a little push to move more</i>” (P10, F, person with SCD). Others used the activity tracker to monitor other aspects of their health, such as “<i>getting my resting heart rate and everything. Then calories and steps and movement. I found that really useful</i>” (P15, M, living with DLB). Step count did not appear to interest other participants, with one explaining how she was “<i>forever walking about doing things</i>” (P19, F, caregiver). Another participant perceived the activity tracker as less useful, explaining how she did not “<i>need another device in my life to tell me what I can and can’t do</i>” (P14, F, living with MCI). This participant was already using a commercially available activity tracker (one that was not provided by the study team) that delivered behavioral prompts, which may have contributed to this sense of being overwhelmed with notifications and reduced perceived autonomy.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec23">Job relevance: clinical usefulness</h4><p>Some participants thought that the data collected by the technology could support more efficient clinical care. One participant described how her doctor had recommended that she use a portable electrocardiogram (ECG) machine at home, and when she noticed her heart rate was too low, she:</p><blockquote class="c-blockquote"><div class="c-blockquote__body">
                    <p><i>“Just simply went to the stuff, printed out the last two weeks, wrote a letter to the GP on the Monday, Tuesday night, she was on the phone reducing my medication. You can’t get more efficient than that</i>” (P22, F, person with SCD).</p>
                  </div></blockquote><p>However, some participants preferred meeting with their healthcare professional in person and having the opportunity to discuss their situation with them, explaining how “<i>otherwise you can’t really ask any questions</i>” (P9, F, living with MCI). Other participants were concerned that the technology might not capture the holistic information needed to support a diagnosis, with one participant sharing the belief that this could only be done by a healthcare professional “<i>actually talking to them [patients] and watching how they move and how they react and what their face is doing and those kind of things.</i>” (P8, M, person with SCD).</p><p>A few participants also observed discrepancies between the activity data (steps) that were collected by the study device (activity tracker) and the activity data (steps) collected by their own devices, with one participant explaining:</p><blockquote class="c-blockquote"><div class="c-blockquote__body">
                    <p>“<i>The watch [their personal one] on one hand and the [study activity tracker] on the other, and the watch says I've done twelve thousand steps, and the [study activity tracker name] says sixteen thousand steps. […] It can’t be accurate</i>” (P2, F, person with SCD).</p>
                  </div></blockquote><p>Others perceived discrepancies in the sleep data collected by the headband in terms of the duration of sleep, describing <i>“I went to bed about nine o’clock at night and I woke at six o’clock in the morning, yet it [headband] told me I’d had three-and-a-half-hour sleep</i>” (P15, M, living with DLB). As well as stages of sleep when compared with another study device (activity tracker); “<i>the [study activity tracker name] will tell me maybe I’ve had 50 min deep [sleep], and then the headset [headband] will tell me I’ve done an hour and a half or two hours [of deep sleep]”</i> (P24, F, person with SCD).</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec24">Transparency</h3><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec25">Lack of coherence</h4><p>A lack of transparency on what data had been collected from wearable technologies appeared to make some participants anxious. They questioned whether their personal information, such as bank account passwords, might have been collected from the passive smartphone app. One participant who shared these concerns <i>“didn’t want that one [passive smartphone app on their phone] because I've got various banks and stuff like that on my phone”</i> (P10, F, person with SCD). Other participants posed questions about the safety of the headband and whether wearing it to obtain the EEG “<i>recording would have a long-term harmful effect</i>” (P3, M, living with MCI).</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec26">Data disclosure concerns</h4><p>Some participants were concerned about whether the health-related data generated from the technology were shared with other entities. One participant wondered if the government might sell their health data to third-party companies, raising <i>“the whole question of how our data is being used and what it’s being used for”</i> (P16, M, living with MCI). The majority believed that health-related data were “<i>not the sort of information I can see being hacked for malicious purposes. Whereas finance, one’s payment processes, ins and outs, clearly is a target for criminality.”</i> (P6, M, person with SCD).</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec27">Behavioral intention</h3><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec28">Lifestyle conflicts</h4><p>Participants reflected on how their daily routine and responsibilities influenced the use of the technologies. Retired participants, without cognitive impairment or with subjective cognitive impairment, commonly reflected on <i>“one of the beauties of being retired is we can do something like this without a struggle, I just fit it in. So it isn’t even a chore”</i> (P22, F, person with SCD), while participants with work or volunteering commitments or greater cognitive impairments noted how it was more challenging to integrate these technologies into their lifestyles. For instance, one of the games within the active smartphone app was “<i>a little bit time-restricting if I'm going to work, because it says, there’s one that says it could be seven minutes long. Well, it may take you longer</i>” (P10, F, person with SCD). Others found that having a set time to do the game on the active smartphone every day or within a fixed time period was inconvenient, especially if it clashed with a work- or volunteering related meeting, as they would “<i>quiet[en] it [the reminder] and then think I’ll do that when I’ve finished, and I forgot”</i> (P15, M, living with DLB).</p></div></div></section><section data-title="Discussion"><div class="c-article-section" id="Sec29-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="Sec29">Discussion</h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec29-content"><p>This study identified several factors affecting the acceptability of wearable technologies for the early detection of dementia-causing diseases among users.

                <h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="FPar1">Authors information</h3>
                <p>The interviewer (EB), a Research Associate at Newcastle University with a PhD in neuroscience and an interest in digital health technologies, did not disclose her background to participants to facilitate open discussions. There was no prior relationship between the participants and the research team. The interviewer was trained by a team member (SW, a Research Assistant who has an MSc in Cognitive Neuroscience and human neuroimaging) experienced in interviewing individuals with cognitive impairment and dementia. The researchers involved in the analysis (SW, CT, SS, RMA) were experienced qualitative researchers at various career stages, with diverse academic backgrounds in pharmacy, neuroscience, and digital health equity. This multidisciplinary approach ensured a comprehensive understanding of participants' experiences and mitigated bias from each researcher's interests.</p>
