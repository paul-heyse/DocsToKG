However, there is a lack of research on the relationship between sleep and psychiatric symptoms and cognitive function in the Chinese older adult population.\nMethods: A total of 621 community older adults aged 60 and older were included in the current study. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), Self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), and Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale (MoCA) were administered to all the participants. Based on PSQI, the research subjects were divided into the good sleep quality group and the bad sleep quality group.

In contrast to newborns, who can sleep 16-20 h a day, many older adults may struggle to get 8 h in one block (2). According to a review article, about 10% of adults suffer from insomnia, another 20% experience insomnia symptoms occasionally, and that figure will rise to 40% for older adults (3). If their sleep is disrupted, they are more likely to suffer from a variety of physical diseases, such as pain, asthma, diabetes, dementia, high blood pressure, immune disorders, physical disability, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (2). In addition, many mental disorders may also be related to sleep disorders. For example, research has found that there is a close correlation between emotional disorders or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and the type of biological clock (4). A systematic review and meta-analysis indicated that sleep disorders increase the risk of developing dementia (5). Other mental disorders, such as anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia, can also be accompanied by sleep disorders (6-8).\nCognitive function is a high-level neural activity function of the human brain's functional cortex, which is used to acquire, transform and process external objective information. It mainly covers categories such as memory, calculation, spatial visual ability, and executive ability (9). The main symptoms of cognitive dysfunction include memory, vision impairment, and executive function disorders, while dementia is the ultimate outcome of severe cognitive impairment, which seriously affects the quality of life of patients and increases the burden on society and families (10). Previous studies have shown that sleep disorders can impair the cognitive abilities of the older adult population, which will increase the likelihood of motor and other traffic accidents, industrial accidents, medical errors, and decreased productivity at work (11). What is more serious is that sleep disorders can also increase the risk of developing dementia, for example, in Bloomberg et al. study, they found that suboptimal sleep were independently associated with worse cognitive performance and short sleep was also associated with faster cognitive decline (12).", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/28", "#/texts/29"], "page_nos": [1], "uuid": "55a51e15-a21e-416a-99aa-2eb291a5be7d"}

For example, Liu et al. found that depression moderated the relationship between poor sleep quality and frailty, reducing the relationship by 51.9% (13). In Li et al. study, they found that long sleep duration was significantly associated with poorer mental status and memory scores in Chinese older adults (4). In Li et al. study, they found that suboptimal sleep duration and poor quality were associated with poor cognitive performance in older adults (14). In addition, in Ren et al. study, they also found that sleep duration was associated with all-cause mortality in a J-shaped pattern in the older adult population in China (15). However, almost all the current similar studies were only phenomenological descriptions and seldom involve the exploration of mechanisms, thus greatly reducing the reliability of these studies.\nImaging is one of the most effective tools to study brain structure and function, and is widely used in clinical and scientific research institutions. In Zou et al. study, they found that patients with insomnia disorders showed decreased thalamic connectivity to the left amygdala, parahippocampal gyrus, putamen, pale cortex, and hippocampus during wakefulness and in all three non-REM sleep stages (16). In Bourgouin et al.'s study, they found that idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep\nbehavior disorder (iRBD) patients showed reduced cortical and subcortical gray matter (GM) volume in the caudate nucleus (17). In Ramduny et al. study, they found that inadequate sleep could cause brain ageing, with more atrophy of white and gray matter (18). Moreover, in Zhao et al. (19) and Lee et al.s (20) study, they also proved that transverse temporal gyrus thickness was associated with different sleep disorders. Thus, hippocampus, amygdala, white matter, gray matter, and transverse temporal gyrus thickness may develop as biomarkers for sleep disorders.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/30", "#/texts/31", "#/texts/35"], "page_nos": [1], "uuid": "ae68b0f7-147d-449d-90cd-4d325d2602da"}

To further explain the related mechanism, we have also included magnetic resonance data. Our hypothesis was that the poorer the sleep quality of the older adults in the community, the more likely they were to have symptoms of anxiety and depression, and had poorer cognitive function. Moreover, it was possible that certain brain structures and cortices, such as the hippocampus, amygdala, white matter, gray matter, and transverse temporal gyrus thickness, played an important role in this process.\n\n2.1 Participants\nThe current cohort study was derived from the Brain Health Cohort study in Shanghai, 1 which has been described in detail in our previous study (21, 22). This cohort included a total of 621 community participants aged 60 years or older. The entry criteria were as follows: (1) aged 60 or more; (2) without severe medical conditions, such as infections, cancer; (3) without serious mental illness, such as severe and depression schizophrenia; (4) be willing to cooperate. Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) aged below 60; (2) non-permanent residents of Shanghai; (3) impaired vision or hearing and unable to cooperate with the investigation; (4) refusal to cooperate. All eligible participants were required to complete a standard questionnaire, including general information data (e.g., age, education, gender), daily living habits (e.g., smoker, drinker, tea drinker, physical exercise) and disease related information (e.g., hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, surgical history, traumatic brain injury, family history of dementia, and family history of sleep disorders). Moreover, they would also undergo a screening process that included physical and neurological examinations, sleep quality assessment, mental state assessment and cognitive assessment. To explore the mechanism of sleep quality affecting mental state and cognitive function, 48 healthy individuals without mild cognitive impairment and dementia accepted brain MR imaging (poor sleeper n = 22; good sleeper n = 26).", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/36", "#/texts/39"], "page_nos": [1], "uuid": "d43eda9a-fe89-498e-bfd6-d64719fd7673"}

GDS-15 is a useful tool for classifying depression in older adults as mild or severe. It is scored on a scale of 0-15, with a score of 5 or more being considered to have depressive symptoms (26). Similar to GDS, SAS is also a common tool for assessing anxiety symptoms in the older adult population (27). SAS is a norm-referenced scale which enjoys widespread use a screener for anxiety disorders. Its score range is 0-30 points. Generally, a score of 10 or more points is considered to be anxiety symptoms. At present, a number of studies have confirmed that SAS has good sensitivity and specificity, which can be applied in clinical and experimental studies (28).", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/41", "#/texts/42", "#/texts/45", "#/texts/47"], "page_nos": [1], "uuid": "76632a75-6bc0-47e4-98a8-cc531476cb73"}

Compared with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), MoCA is more sensitive and sensitive to screening for cognitive dysfunction (30).\n\n2.5 Magnetic resonance image acquisition and processing\nThe images were acquired by Siemens Magnetom Verio 3.0 T scanner (Siemens, Munich, Germany), which has been described in detail in our previous article (31, 32). In short, T1-weighted images were obtained from 176 sagittal sections using the threedimensional magnetization fast gradient echo acquisition sequence.

In the current study, we investigated the relationship between sleep quality, mental state and cognitive function among older adults in Chinese communities, and found that (1) nearly half of the older adults in the community had poor sleep quality; (2) advanced age and a family history of sleep disorders were strongly associated with poor sleep quality; (3) poor sleepers were likely to have more anxiety and depressive symptoms; (4)anxiety symptoms were positively correlated with the left transverse temporal gyrus thickness.\nBy using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), we found that nearly half of the Chinese older adults in the community had poor sleep quality, and advanced age as well as family history of sleep disorders were major factors in poor sleep quality. Monane et al. (35) estimated that nearly half of people over the age of 65 suffered from insomnia. Moreover, Vitiello et al. also found that older women tend to report sleep disorders more frequently than older men (36), and hormone deficiencies were likely to play an important role in this process (37). So our findings were basically consistent. With the increase of age, the disturbance of sleep rhythm and the reduction of sleep demand often occur, which may lead to the occurrence of sleep disorders. Alternatively, in some patients, insomnia may be caused by an underlying medical condition or a side effect of medication (secondary insomnia) (38).

Moreover, McKinnon et al. found that sleep disturbances seemed to predict depressive symptoms (42). So we know with some certainty that sleep problems may be associated with anxiety symptoms and mood symptoms. However, contrary to our expectations, we did not find an association between sleep problems and cognitive function, contrary to the studies by Liao et al. (10) and Guan et al. (43). The reasons may be related to the use of different assessment tools and group differences. Moreover, this might also be related to the fact that we only evaluated the overall cognitive function without specifically evaluating the cognitive function in specific domains. Additionally, when enrolling the above-mentioned population, such as in the study of the second part, we excluded patients with mild cognitive impairment and dementia, and all the subjects enrolled in the study were healthy people. This is also the core reason for the lack of cognitive differences.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/tables/3", "#/pictures/2", "#/texts/76"], "page_nos": [1], "uuid": "74aaaae1-5d05-4f3b-b19f-5a0bea5f31f8"}

Through linear regression analysis, we found there was a positive correlation between the total score of SAS and the cortical thickness of the left transverse temporal gyrus. The transverse temporal gyrus, also known as the Heschl gyrus or Heschl cyclotron, is part of the larger region of the superior temporal gyrus. It includes the lower two-thirds of the primary auditory cortex, and the anterolateral subregion, which is important for pitch processing (44). In Jin et al.'s study, they found that the transverse temporal gyrus thickness was associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in patients with childhood trauma (45). In Qi et al. study, they found that the transverse temporal gyrus thickness was associated with PTSD symptom severity in Han Chinese adults who lost their only child (44). Moreover, in Cruz-Gomez et al. study, they also found that the right superior and transverse temporal gyri was associated with anxiety symptoms in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) (46). Based on our and others' research conclusions, we speculate that\nthe cortical thickness of transverse temporal gyrus may be related to anxiety symptoms and may be a new therapeutic target for anxiety symptoms, but the above conclusions need to be further verified.\nWe must admit that our study has several limitations. Firstly, this was only a cross-sectional study, so it could not establish a causal link between sleep quality and mood symptoms; Secondly, the magnetic resonance data was relatively small, which might cause some deviation to the research results.
