Neuroinflammation is a key mechanism driving these conditions. This literature review synthesizes evidence from studies published between 2020 and 2025, focusing on the role of neuroinflammation in PASC-related neurological outcomes, its underlying mechanisms, and potential therapeutic approaches. Findings indicate that persistent cytokine elevation, blood-brain barrier disruption, microglial activation, and oxidative stress contribute to symptoms. Cognitive deficits and fatigue are the most studied, with emerging links to dementia and Parkinson's disease. Antioxidant therapies and anti-inflammatory interventions show promise, but further research is needed. This review highlights the importance of addressing neuroinflammation in long COVID management and calls for standardized biomarkers and longitudinal studies.\nKeywords: Long COVID, neuroinflammation, chronic neurological conditions, post-acute sequelae, cytokines, oxidative stress\n\n1 Introduction\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has affected millions worldwide since 2019. While primarily a respiratory illness, its long-term effects, known as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC) or long COVID, frequently involve neurological symptoms, including cognitive impairment (\"brain fog\"), fatigue, mood disorders, sleep disturbances, and increased risk of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's (?). Neuroinflammation, characterized by persistent immune activation in the central nervous system (CNS), is a central mechanism linking acute infection to these chronic conditions (?). This literature review examines recent studies (2020-2025) to explore the role of neuroinflammation in post-COVID neurological\nconditions, its mechanisms, and potential treatments, aiming to inform clinical practice and future research.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/219", "#/texts/221", "#/texts/222", "#/texts/224", "#/texts/229"], "page_nos": [1]}

Search terms included \"neuroinflammation,\" \"long COVID,\" \"post-COVID neurological sequelae,\" and \"chronic neurological conditions.\" Inclusion criteria prioritized systematic reviews, meta-analyses, cohort studies, and neuroimaging studies examining inflammation markers (e.g., cytokines, PET imaging) in PASC patients. Approximately 20-30 studies were screened, with 10-15 selected based on sample size, methodological rigor, and relevance. Study quality was assessed informally using criteria such as sample size and methodology reliability. Evidence was evaluated using GRADE criteria, focusing on observational and imaging studies.\n\n3.1 Cognitive Impairment and Brain Fog\nCognitive deficits, including memory issues and brain fog, affect 20-25% of PASC patients and may persist beyond 12 months (?). A review of 167 studies identified elevated inflammatory markers, such as glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and interleukin-8 (IL-8), correlating with cognitive symptoms (?). Neuroimaging using [11C] PBR28 PET revealed increased inflammation in brain regions like the thalamus and basal ganglia, associated with cognitive impairment (?). A 2025 meta-analysis confirmed persistent cognitive and psychopathological issues in recovered patients, linked to inflammation markers at three-month follow-up (?).", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/231", "#/texts/234"], "page_nos": [1]}
