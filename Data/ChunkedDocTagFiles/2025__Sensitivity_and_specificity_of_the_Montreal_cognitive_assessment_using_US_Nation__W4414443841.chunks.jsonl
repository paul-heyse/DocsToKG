Several screening tools are available for diagnosing various types of dementia, including the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and the Dementia Rating Scale (DRS).\nObjective This study aims to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of MoCA to determine its suitability as a screening tool.\nMethods This study analyzed data from participants aged 55 and older, recruited from U.S. Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers (ADRCs), using a National Alzheimer Coordinating Center Uniformed Data Set (NACC-UDS). Participants were classified based on patient records into demented and non-demented groups, with the nondemented group further categorized into those with normal cognition and cognitive impairment (CI). This analysis examines the correlation between these classifications and MoCA scores.\nResults This study utilized an initial dataset of 188,700 participant records from NACC. After applying inclusion criteria, 16,309 participants were included. The participants had complete diagnostic information, clinician-conducted cognitive assessments, and MoCA scores. The participants were categorized into three groups: 7,624 with no cognitive impairment (NoCI), 4,893 with CI, and 3,792 with dementia. This study focused on MoCA scores, revealing significant differences among diagnostic groups. ROC analysis demonstrated the MoCA's strong diagnostic capability, with AUC values significantly above 0.5 ( P\n*Correspondence: Youssef A.

With a high NPV of 94%, MoCA is particularly reliable for ruling out dementia.

Despite continuous medical research efforts to discover effective treatments for NDDs the results have been disappointing [3].\nThere are many screening tools available, but the Saint Louis University Mental Status Examination (SLUMS) [6], a 30-point questionnaire, is highly validated for screening both MCI and dementia. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) [7] also can be used but the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) [8] and the Dementia Rating Scale (DRS) [9] are not recommended in detecting MCI and early-stage dementia [10, 11, 12, 13]. Both, MoCA and MMSE, are accurate in detecting AD, but MoCA has been reported superior to MMSE in identifying MCI [12].\nAccurate assessment of general cognitive ability in older adults is crucial to identify those at higher risk of developing dementia and to evaluate the efficacy of clinical trials conducted on individuals living with dementia. The MoCA is a neuropsychological screening tool designed to measure cognitive functioning and decline. It effectively distinguishes between different states of cognitive impairment, but this is not the same as distinguishing between the etiologies, and is standardized for individuals aged 55-85 [14, 15]. It is scored on a 30-point scale and can be administered in 10 min. The MoCA evaluates short-term memory, visuospatial/executive functioning, attention, concentration, working memory, language, and orientation to place and time [14].", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/20", "#/texts/21", "#/texts/22", "#/texts/23"], "page_nos": [1], "uuid": "08cb47a2-2cd3-459d-90f6-65be391e329c"}

Additionally, the newly introduced MoCA Memory Index Score helps clinicians predict which participants with MCI are most likely to advance to dementia [16, 17].\nIn a Delphi Global Consensus conducted in 2023, the MoCA was ranked the top tool out of 53 for assessing cognitive abilities in clinical practice [18, 19]. Studies compared the cognitive assessment capabilities of the MoCA and the MMSE, finding that MoCA is more effective at detecting dementia. In contrast to a 2015 study that considered the MMSE the best and most frequently used screening tool for evaluating cognitive impairment, other studies found that the MoCA is more effective at detecting dementia [16, 20].\nIn order to address previous studies' limitations of relatively small sample size and to be more comprehensive, this study aims to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) to determine its suitability as a screening tool in screening programs.\n\nParticipants\nVolunteers recruited from Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers (ADRCs) funded by the National Institute on Aging across the United States participated in the study.

There were more female participants in each group, which is representative of the old age psychiatry population.\nIt was found that the prevalence of dementia rises as individuals become older, as demonstrated by a comprehensive review that found that about one in four adults between 90 and 91 years old are affected [25]. Female participants constituted a larger portion in each category. The NACC cohort may be subject to sampling biases, as women are often more likely to participate in studies, potentially due to caregiving roles or other factors [26]. In contrast, an American study revealed that males are more prone to CI and dementia [27].\nThe study demonstrated that, over the past two years, active depression levels were elevated in all groups, which was statistically significant, with higher levels of depression in more cognitive-impaired population, and with highest levels observed in individuals with dementia (33%).\nThis result indicates that there is a close connection between them, emphasizing the strong ties between emotions and cognitive health. This finding contrasts with prior research as reported that cognitive defects may continue even after the active phase of depression has remitted [28]. On the contrary, Song et al., showed that there is an association between depression and MCI [29]. Furthermore, an observational study revealed that within five years, more than 70% of old participants with pseudodementia developed overt dementia, while only 18% of intact participants did. This clearly illustrates that cognitive impairment in old individuals with depression is a significant predictor of subsequent dementia [30].\nIn this study, the MoCA had a sensitivity of 83% for detecting mild dementia (\n\nTable 1 Baseline characteristics of study participants", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/59", "#/texts/60", "#/texts/61", "#/texts/62", "#/texts/63", "#/texts/67", "#/tables/0"], "page_nos": [1], "uuid": "611ce684-09f0-49b8-85a1-4698b5c9e67c"}

Equally, a Chinese crosssection study done on 7445 participants to determine cutoff scores of MoCA-P (Peking Medical Union College Hospital version of the MoCA) demonstrated that age group (80-89) years old was also 21 [39]. As expected, this used cutoff value succeeded as shown in a cross-section study done on 710 participants [38]. It is important to note that this variation can happen based on the population, setting and population's features that widely vary.\nThe study also exhibited that 24 is the optimal cutoff value to detect CI with maximum Youden index reflecting high effectiveness. It also showed valuable PPV (79%) and NPV (66%) indicating moderate ability to screen and rule out CI.\nThis study has several limitations. Its retrospective design depends on the quality and completeness of existing data, potentially introducing selection bias due to the specific inclusion criteria of participants from ADCs. The generalizability of findings is limited, as the study population may not reflect broader or more diverse groups. A large portion of the initial dataset was excluded, affecting the robustness of results. The identified MoCA cutoff scores may not be universally applicable, and the low PPV of the MoCA for mild dementia suggests limited diagnostic utility in similar prevalence settings. Exclusion of follow-up data prevents assessment of cognitive changes over time, and cultural and ethnic differences in cognitive performance were not addressed, further limiting the generalizability of the findings. Using NACC data, this study's cognitive classifications (NoCI, CI, Dem) are limited by inconsistencies with reported IADL independence. IADL limitations in some NoCI/ CI participants suggest potential misclassification due to NACC data variations, possibly affecting MoCA/GCR findings. Future studies should use more standardized assessments.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/96", "#/texts/97", "#/texts/98"], "page_nos": [1], "uuid": "c68af890-7b29-4c39-87ef-e5f578ef9023"}

These findings are consistent with the literature, where MoCA is frequently validated as a reliable screening tool for cognitive impairments. And its ability to detect MCI is moderate, showing a sensitivity of 77% at cutoff value of 24\namong normal population. Despite this, MoCA's specificity of 69% predispose to false positives for MCI.\nTaking the above results into account, one can conclude that MoCA can be useful in clinical settings to identify individuals requiring further diagnostic evaluation and confirm normal cognitive functioning.
