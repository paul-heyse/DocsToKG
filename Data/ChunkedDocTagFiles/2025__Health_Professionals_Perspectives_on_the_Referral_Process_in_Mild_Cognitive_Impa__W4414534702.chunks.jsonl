Few studies explore the quality and underlying context of referral decision-making by Primary Care Clinicians. This study aimed to explore the perspectives of healthcare professionals from Northern Portugal regarding the facilitators, barriers, and solutions within the referral process to the Neurology service for patients suspected of having mild cognitive impairment.\nMethods: Two face-to-face focus groups were conducted with 11 primary and secondary care professionals from Northern Portugal, with experience in the field of dementia, selected and recruited through an email invitation. The discussion focused on the benefits of referrals, the strengths and challenges faced at different levels of care, and possible improvement strategies. Data were analyzed using inductive and deductive thematic analysis, with triangulation employed to ensure research rigor.\nResults: The study identified facilitators and barriers at the levels of patients and caregivers, healthcare professionals, and the healthcare system. This process is influenced by interconnected factors, including the sociodemographic and literacy context of patients and caregivers, clinical practice regarding the application of referral criteria, and the organizational and research context of the local healthcare system concerning dementia. Solutions were proposed to overcome the highlighted barriers, whose implementation is supported by many of the facilitators described.\nConclusion: A deeper understanding of the interplay between sociodemographic, clinical, and organizational factors can lead to more objective and effective referral decisions, ultimately supporting timely diagnosis and enhancing quality of life. The findings of this study are valuable for optimizing local referral processes and may be useful in similar healthcare contexts. It is recommended that future research include the perspectives of patients and caregivers to enhance the approach to the national dementia strategy.\nKeywords: Attitude of Health Personnel; Caregivers; Cognitive Dysfunction; Portugal; Referral and Consultation", "doc_items_refs": ["#/pictures/0", "#/texts/2", "#/texts/4", "#/texts/5", "#/texts/6", "#/texts/7", "#/texts/8"], "page_nos": [1], "uuid": "99b5fbe2-51c3-4192-ae7e-f55b9b0fd9bd"}

Time constraints, limited competence concerning the provision of information about dementia by PCCs, and the belief that specialists manage dementia significantly better than PCCs may negatively impact the referral pathway, which may lead to an increase in the number of referrals, though not necessarily to an increase in their accuracy. Similar challenges have been reported in other countries, 11 including insufficient public and medical awareness about dementia, stigma, and bureaucratic hurdles, as described in a study performed in Southern Brazil. 12\nThere is a lack of research focused on understanding how the referral pathway is initiated within the Portuguese national healthcare system.

We invited healthcare professionals from the North of Portugal, working in primary and secondary care. Heterogeneity sampling was used to maximize the inclusion of different views and experiences by including healthcare professionals from different fields. Participants were invited directly by the principal investigator, based on previously established professional connections in the scope of the study. Participants only became aware of the reasons for conducting the research after the invitation, so there was no conflict of interest between them and the authors. This invitation was sent by email, and responses were given in the same way. Of the 16 healthcare professionals invited to participate in the study, three declined the invitation due to professional unavailability, and two others did not respond. Therefore, 11 participants were recruited and distributed equally across the sessions of focus groups, in terms of number and professional activity: in the first session there were three nurses specialized in mental health, one general and family medicine resident, a neuropsychologist and a clinical psychologist, while in the second there were the other four primary care professionals (three nurses specialized in mental health and one family medicine resident) and one neurologist. The sessions took place in the same location, which consisted of the facilities of a Family Health Unit (FHU).\nThe number of participants was estimated based on the concept of information power. 14 The greater the richness,\nquality, and relevance of the information discussed for the objective of the study, the less the need to increase the sample size.

Provider-level facilitators were the most frequently emphasized.\nAt the individual level, the academic and digital literacy of patients and caregivers was highlighted as a key facilitator of the referral process, since higher literacy enhances the effectiveness of interventions targeting the improvement of the referral pathway. Additionally, patients and caregivers in urban areas were perceived as having higher literacy levels [Appendix 2, section A.1.2. of the Table (Appendix 2: https://www.actamedicaportuguesa.com/revista/index.php/amp/article/ view/23241/15755)]. Another relevant facilitator was the greater awareness of cognitive impairment and its impact on quality of life among the general population, particularly among economically advantaged families and young adults diagnosed with dementia, which improves assertive communication of cognitive symptoms to PCCs [Appendix 2, section A.1.3.

Additionally, there was consensus on the increased awareness among healthcare professionals of the need for early detection of MCI, supported by the use of validated cognitive assessment tools and continuous training on ongoing community projects. Proximity to patients was also a facilitating factor, allowing a better understanding of cognitive evolution and family and social context, therefore guiding referral decisions [Appendix 2, section A.2.1.1.

These behaviors increase the risk of MCI or early dementia cases being missed, delaying treatment and follow-up. Participants also pointed out that PCCs do not always apply referral criteria objectively, often ranking them subjectively based on what they perceive as a high-quality referral decision, instead. The most valued criteria are: i) expected benefits of early referral; ii) belief in the absence of clinical progression in 10 - 20 years after MCI diagnosis; iii) information from family and caregivers; iv) clinical progression between appointments, and v) planning for possible future clinical decline.

Additionally, a lack of systematic monitoring of neurology waiting lists and limited dementia prevention activities were noted, largely due to human resource shortages. Healthcare professionals often lack availability for mental health promotion initiatives, and mandatory compliance with non-dementia-related health indicators further reduces dementia prioritization. In secondary care, major barriers include neurology appointment waiting times exceeding 12 months and an insufficient number of hospital medical offices to meet demand [Appendix 2, section B.3.1.3.

Additionally, limited research funding and external dependency for financial support were highlighted as weaknesses in cognitive decline research [Appendix 2, section B.3.2. (Appendix 2: https://www.actamedicaportuguesa.com/revista/index.php/amp/article/view/23241/15755)].

They emphasized the need to improve their ability to make accurate referral decisions, suggesting they should be more assertive towards all cognitive complaints, in order to screen for a differential psychological diagnosis, conduct systematic assessments in consecutive appointments, and consult neurology services when in doubt [Appendix 2, section C.2.1.1. (Appendix 2: https://www.actamedicaportuguesa.com/revista/index.php/amp/article/ view/23241/15755)]. Additionally, they recommended increasing post-referral support by ensuring immediate access to necessary support services, as well as encouraging families and caregivers to improve home-based monitoring and patient care. Encouraging more discussions among healthcare professionals about clinical cases was also considered crucial for better diagnosis and decision-making [Appendix 2, section C.2.1.1. (Appendix 2: https://www.actamedicaportuguesa.com/revista/index.php/amp/article/view/23241/15755)]. Regarding referral criteria, participants suggested that PCCs should consistently follow and prioritize referral criteria, making decisions more objective and structured [Appendix 2, section C.2.1.2. (Appendix 2: https://www.actamedicaportuguesa.com/revista/index.php/amp/article/view/23241/15755)]. They also emphasized the importance of enhancing the ability of PCCs to accurately identify real cases and avoid unnecessary referrals, which contribute to long neurology waiting lists [Appendix 2, section C.2.1.2. (Appendix 2: https://www. actamedicaportuguesa.com/revista/index.php/amp/article/view/23241/15755)]. The use of validated cognitive tests and clinical evaluations should be reinforced in decision-making. To improve the performance of healthcare teams, participants highlighted the need for stronger prevention strategies and early diagnosis prioritization. They proposed better collaboration within the healthcare network to implement cognitive function monitoring from age 65, track mistakenly non-referred patients, and promote mental health awareness [Appendix 2, section C.2.2.1.

Participants also suggested strategies to enhance patient follow-up and family engagement, including: i) adding family and caregiver information to medical records; ii) documenting the professional background and literacy of patients, and iii) introducing remote self-administered digital tools for cognitive\nassessment [Appendix 2, section C.2.2.2. (Appendix 2: https://www.actamedicaportuguesa.com/revista/index.php/amp/ article/view/23241/15755)]. These strategies aim to personalize interventions and improve access to cognitive training. It is very important for the planning of a long-term care service, either in healthcare facilities or at home, that the involvement of a family member or caregiver during appointments is considered, as these people should be highly engaged in the definition of milestones during the patient journey. By knowing the literacy level of patients, it will be possible to design more tailored interventions during the follow-up, for instance, as it is the case of engaging in digital cognitive training, or to assess cognitive status through digital self-administered platforms, if patients have digital literacy. Therefore, the use of remote tools may overcome constraints of time and human resources observed at healthcare facilities. Participants also mentioned the need for an improved early detection of changes in executive cognitive function, specifically, as an indicator of dementia [Appendix 2, section C.2.2.2. (Appendix 2: https://www.actamedicaportuguesa.com/revista/index.php/amp/ article/view/23241/15755)], but they did not specify a strategy to accomplish it.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/85", "#/texts/92"], "page_nos": [1], "uuid": "47b4b546-f6b8-473f-a995-7543f77cbf36"}

They proposed increasing human resources to support patients and caregivers, improving training for the detection of early cognitive impairment, and optimizing referral screening processes [Appendix 2, section C.3.1.1. (Appendix 2: https://www.actamedicaportuguesa.com/ revista/index.php/amp/article/view/23241/15755)]. To strengthen collaborative work, they suggested better integration of ongoing projects within local healthcare clusters and improved communication with external healthcare teams [Appendix 2, section C.3.1.1. (Appendix 2: https://www.actamedicaportuguesa.com/revista/index.php/amp/article/view/23241/15755)]. For primary care services, recommendations included longer appointments with PCCs, more social workers per FHU, and the implementation of a specialized appointment for cognitive screening [Appendix 2, section C.3.1.2. (Appendix 2: https:// www.actamedicaportuguesa.com/revista/index.php/amp/article/view/23241/15755)]. At the secondary care level, solutions included: i) increasing medical offices for neurology care; ii) expanding human resources, and iii) reducing neurology waiting times to three months [Appendix 2, section C.3.1.3. (Appendix 2: https://www.actamedicaportuguesa.com/revista/ index.php/amp/article/view/23241/15755)]. These measures are interconnected, as more medical offices will lead to better specialized care and shorter waiting lists. Finally, participants emphasized investment in research on cognitive decline and the referral system. They proposed integrating externally funded projects into healthcare services and increasing internal research initiatives [Appendix 2, section C.3.2. (Appendix 2: https://www.actamedicaportuguesa.com/revista/index.php/ amp/article/view/23241/15755)]. To improve the referral system, they suggested refining referral criteria, creating a classification system for prioritization, and monitoring compliance with referral standards [Appendix 2, section C.3.3.

As most of the research has aimed to find facilitators and barriers, we highlight the relevance of looking for solutions to existing barriers and testing their feasibility. Therefore, participants proposed diverse solutions, whose implementation could be enhanced by some of the described facilitators.\nAt the individual level, the findings suggest that raising dementia awareness may help overcome literacy-related challenges, such as the difficult acceptance by family and caregivers, and the high subjectivity and lack of knowledge in reporting cognitive complaints to PCCs. López et al corroborated this idea, demonstrating that high social awareness of early diagnosis for cognitive problems facilitates medical help-seeking behaviors in cases of cognitive complaints. 16 However, inequality in access to services for patients referred outside the local healthcare context raises ethical concerns, 16 as limited coordination between healthcare teams, identified in this study as an organizational barrier, may lead to fewer referrals and delays in care.\nDespite the aforementioned barriers, participants did not propose specific solutions. This lack of proposals may stem from a lack of prioritization of these issues or the perception that significant changes concerning sociodemographic and literacy contexts of the local population are difficult to achieve in a timely manner.\nAt the provider level, primary care teams show positive behaviors by using validated cognitive tests, although their sensitivity for detecting MCI is sometimes questioned. 16 Previous research emphasizes the benefits of routine cognitive testing by PCCs, as it enhances their knowledge and improves attitudes toward managing patients with suspected dementia. 11\nDespite the encouraging pattern of early referrals observed in the study, stigmatization and skepticism about the benefits of an MCI diagnosis remain persistent challenges, affecting the consistency of referral practices. Some studies suggest that certain PCCs do not perceive substantial benefits from diagnosing dementia due to the lack of truly effective treatment options to halt its progression. 17,18 Concerning stigma, it may hinder transparent communication of the diagnosis to patients and caregivers, thereby limiting proper planning for MCI progression and increasing the risk of unsafe behaviors, as previously described. 19", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/95", "#/texts/96", "#/texts/97", "#/texts/98", "#/texts/103"], "page_nos": [1], "uuid": "911d860f-8e43-4645-a23e-31d5bc016d11"}

Increased post-referral support provided by PCCs, in light of the shortage of social workers, in addition to structured training on referral criteria, to enhance its objective use by PCCs, were also highlighted as potential solutions for the overall barriers mentioned. Furthermore, the close relationships PCCs often maintain with patients were identified as facilitators, 21,22 by improving their ability to detect subtle cognitive changes, although we did not find evidence in the literature for this.\nBased on these findings, we hypothesize that systematically implementing direct communication pathways between primary and secondary care, alongside with clearly defined referral criteria and standardized clinical observations, could help overcome the identified barriers. In particular, the use of enhanced cognitive brief assessment tools, such as digital self-administered instruments, may improve the objectivity and reliability of referral decisions. Supporting the value attributed to digital tools for remote cognitive assessment in improving referral decision-making are the findings of two systematic reviews published in 2021. 23,24 They examined the diagnostic accuracy of digital health and telemedicine-based technologies for MCI and dementia, compared to traditional paper-based cognitive tests, indicating that telehealth can reliably detect cognitive impairment similarly to in-person assessments. Additionally, implementing remote assessment and monitoring of cognitive function may abolish time and human resources constraints, especially in primary care facilities. Not highlighted in this study is the diagnostic utility of blood biomarkers as minimally invasive, cost-effective, and scalable alternative tools to cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, particularly phosphorylated tau (p-Tau) variants such as p-Tau181 and p-Tau217. 25 Integrating them into the daily clinical practice of PCCs will most probably improve their capacity to make more objective referral decisions.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/104", "#/texts/105"], "page_nos": [1], "uuid": "97b9437f-3e9f-4acf-831c-b82c31e51270"}

On the other hand, the lack of support for research projects probably contributes to the apparent lack of prioritization of dementia among other chronic diseases.

Their participation would have certainly enriched the discussion. However, in the setting where the study took place, individuals with early cognitive complaints are usually referred by PCCs to neurology care. Referrals to psychiatry are much less common and mainly for patients with more advanced disease and usually overt behavioral issues. Given that the aim was to better understand the care pathway of patients presenting with early memory complaints, the involvement of psychiatrists was not deemed essential in this context. Furthermore, despite their valuable role in screening procedures, public health clinicians are not presently integrated as allied professionals within the referral pathway in the local healthcare setting under study. Overall, it is unfortunate to acknowledge that the findings may be context-specific, potentially limiting their generalizability to regions with differing healthcare structures and service availability. On the other hand, as far as it is known, this is the first study to capture the particularities of a specific healthcare context in Portugal. More studies in other settings could better represent perspectives of professionals who are working in other healthcare contexts. While the perspectives of patients, family members, and caregivers were not incorporated in this study due to its specific focus on healthcare professionals, we recognize the relevance of these viewpoints and aim to explore them in a future study. Another important aspect to consider is the fact that participants did not spontaneously highlight the need for PCCs to screen for potential treatable causes of cognitive decline before deciding whether to refer or not, such as urinary and respiratory infections, deficiency in vitamins, hypothyroidism, medication, and depression.
