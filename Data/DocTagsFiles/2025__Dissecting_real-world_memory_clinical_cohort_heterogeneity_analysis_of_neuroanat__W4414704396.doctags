<text><loc_53><loc_169><loc_446><loc_199>Background There is significant evidence for neuroanatomical heterogeneity in neurodegenerative disorders, which has been demonstrated predominantly through analyses of well-characterized research cohorts. Despite the known diversity in clinical presentations among patients attending memory clinics, studies exploring neuroanatomical heterogeneity in such clinically diverse groups remain sparse.</text>
<text><loc_53><loc_201><loc_449><loc_254>Methods To address this gap, we applied the semi-supervised Heterogeneity through Discriminative Analysis (HYDRA) (Neuroimage 145:346-364 2017) machine learning method to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) (NeuroImage 26:102248 2020) to uncover patterns of neurostructural heterogeneity in memory clinic attendees. Cross-validation was used to assess clustering stability via the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI), Silhouette Score, and Calinski-Harabasz Index (CHI). We performed survival analyses using Kaplan-Meier curves and mixed-effects models for longitudinal cognitive data (e.g., memory, executive function, and language assessments) to examine differences in disease progression.</text>
<text><loc_53><loc_256><loc_448><loc_324>Results Cross-validation analyses indicated two highly stable subtypes of cognitively impaired individuals (ARI = 0.552), exhibiting significant neuroanatomical differences. Subtype 1, termed the Temporal-Sparing Atrophy (TSA) Subtype, was defined by relatively mild atrophy, especially in temporal areas, with slower cognitive decline and preserved Function across most domains. Subtype 2, termed the Temporal-Parietal Predominated Atrophy (TPPA) Subtype, was marked by notable alterations in areas critically affected in neurodegenerative disorders. These included key areas critical for executive function and memory, such as the frontal, temporal, and parietal cortices including the precuneus. Longitudinal analysis of neuroimaging and cognitive data revealed contrasting trajectories. The TSA Subtype demonstrated a gradual decline in cognitive functions over time, particularly in the assessments that are memory-focused tests. Conversely, the TPPA Subtype exhibited a more severe decline in these functions.</text>
<text><loc_53><loc_326><loc_448><loc_364>Conclusions This research illustrates that neurodegenerative diseases present a spectrum of structural brain changes rather than uniform pathology, suggesting that future research may benefit from stratified therapeutic approaches and targeted recruitment strategies for clinical trials. By leveraging detailed clinical assessments and longitudinal data, including uncertain diagnoses and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scores, this study contributes to better understanding/characterizing memory clinic populations, which could help with optimizing interventions.</text>

<text><loc_47><loc_63><loc_248><loc_201>Neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Parkinson's Disease (PD) [1] and others, exhibit significant heterogeneity, challenging the notion of a "typical" disease presentation [2]. Importantly, clinicians encounter a spectrum of cognitive and neuroanatomical variations among patients, which are often influenced by multiple risk factors and comorbidities. This heterogeneity is critical to understand, as it impacts diagnostic accuracy, disease prognosis, and therapeutic response [3]. Characterizing disease heterogeneity within real-world clinical cohorts by identifying neurobiologically homogeneous clusters of patients can lead to more precise diagnoses and targeted treatments [4]. To this end, neuroimaging provides a reliable and reproducible noninvasive in vivo method to assess the neurobiology of brain disorders, and dementia in particular. However, the high dimensionality and complexity of neuroimaging data present significant analytical challenges.</text>
<text><loc_47><loc_200><loc_248><loc_345>Over the past few decades, machine learning methods have emerged as an effective way to address these challenges because of their ability to capture complex relationships of imaging signals among brain regions [5]. This capability enhances the characterization of group differences, potentially leading to improved personalized diagnosis and prognosis, Consequently, machine learning has been increasingly successful in driving highly sensitive and specific disease biomarkers at the individual level [6]. For example, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) effectively classified patients based on neuroimaging features [7, 8], while Random Forests predicted disease progression and identified biomarkers [9, 10]. However, a common assumption behind commonly used machine learning methods is that there is a single pattern that differentiates the two contrasted groups. While this approach enables the detection of hallmark pathology, it ignores disease heterogeneity, potentially overlooking distinct neuroanatomical subtypes.</text>
<text><loc_47><loc_343><loc_248><loc_452>Recent advancements address this limitation by leveraging unsupervised or semi-supervised methods [11-21]. Prior research studies have primarily investigated heterogeneity within well-characterized research cohorts. However, these cohorts do not represent well the variability seen in clinical practice. This limitation is particularly evident in memory clinic populations, where patients present with diverse cognitive profiles and often have uncertain diagnoses. Despite this, investigations into the neurobiological heterogeneity of dementia in clinical settings are scarce. Additionally, while longitudinal cognitive data may offer invaluable insights into disease progression, these are often overlooked in heterogeneity analyses of research or real-world clinical cohorts [22].</text>

<text><loc_255><loc_55><loc_457><loc_215>In response to these gaps in the field, we investigated the heterogeneity of neurodegeneration using data from a large publicly available sample of patients and their follow-ups seen at the Washington University Memory Diagnostic Center outpatient clinic in Saint Louis, MO by applying the HYDRA (heterogeneity through discriminative analysis) algorithm [23] to the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS-4) dataset [24], a clinically representative cohort with neuroimaging and longitudinal clinical data. Specifically, we sought to identify neuroanatomical subtypes using a semi-supervised machine learning method termed HYDRA. HYDRA is a well-established and validated method that has been successfully applied in various neurological and psychiatric disorders, consistently uncovering biologically meaningful and homogeneous clusters within heterogeneous patient populations [25-29]. We hypothesized that HYDRA would objectively reveal distinct neuroanatomical subtypes by analyzing volumetric data. We further hypothesized that the identified subtypes would exhibit distinct clinical and cognitive longitudinal trajectories.</text>

<text><loc_255><loc_238><loc_456><loc_269>To implement HYDRA, a patient group and a reference group of controls are needed to identify structural subtypes. Two datasets were used for patients and controls separately for this purpose.</text>
<text><loc_255><loc_268><loc_457><loc_375>The OASIS-4 dataset was employed to extract patients specifically, sourced from patients seen at the Washington University in St. Louis Memory Diagnostic Center outpatient clinic. This memory clinic cohort provides comprehensive neuroimaging and longitudinal clinical data from individuals with memory disorders and dementia. Patients at various stages of impairment underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and clinical assessments. From this dataset, we included 580 individuals aged 50 to 94 who passed FreeSurfer [30] quality checks. Longitudinal clinical assessments were available for a subset of participants. Though the number and timing of follow-up visits varied, it is a hallmark of real-world clinical data, where patients are assessed as needed rather than at fixed intervals.</text>
<text><loc_255><loc_374><loc_457><loc_452>We utilized OASIS-3 dataset [31] coming from the Washington University Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) - a research-based cohort, which is used to derive a robust reference group of cognitively unimpaired (CU) controls. We identified 536 CU individuals based on a global Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) [32] of 0 and amyloid negative. Amyloid negativity was defined as the absence of substantial preclinical cognitive impairment pathology, assessed using either cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers or amyloid positron</text>

For amyloid PET, the Centiloid scale [33-35] was used to standardize quantitative amyloid measurements across different tracers and methods. A Centiloid value of ≤ 20 was used as the threshold for amyloid negativity, consistent with the widely accepted cutoff for distinguishing amyloid-negative individuals from those with amyloid-positive pathology [36]. For CSF, amyloid negativity was determined based on the Aβ42/40 ratio that minimizes variability caused by preanalytical factors (e.g., tube adsorption) and interindividual differences in total Aβ production. A threshold of Aβ42/40</text>

<text><loc_47><loc_236><loc_248><loc_291>Analysis of the demographic data (see Table 1) revealed significant differences between the clinical group from OASIS-4 and CU controls from OASIS-3 across several key variables. The CU control group was younger and consisted of a higher proportion of females, while the clinical group was older on average and had a more balanced gender distribution.

Similarly, the MiniMental State Examination (MMSE) [38] scores differed markedly, with the clinical group showing an average score of 22.9, indicative of cognitive decline, compared to 28.9 in CU controls.</text>

<text><loc_255><loc_131><loc_457><loc_200>Our analysis focused on 3 T T1-weighted volumetric MRI data to investigate brain atrophy patterns characteristic of AD. Regional volumes were processed with FreeSurfer [30] version 5.3, based on the DesikanKillian atlas [39]. To account for head size variations, total intracranial volume adjustment [40] was applied to normalize regional volumes across participants. Lastly, regional volumes were z-scored using the CU control group as the reference for normalization.</text>

As a result, HYDRA uncovers distinct neuroimaging patterns that characterize subtypes and clusters cases by focusing on their differences from control subjects. This is contrast to unsupervised clustering techniques (e.g., k-means), which group participants based on their similarities. Lastly, HYDRA adjusts for important covariates such as age and gender, ensuring robust clustering. Note that HYDRA only uses a binary classification objective, distinguishing healthy controls from patients, to guide the discovery of multiple disease subtypes. Importantly, it does not utilize detailed diagnostic labels (e.g., mild cognitive impairment or AD) or clinical outcomes during training, allowing for the identification of data-driven neuroanatomical patterns.</text>
<text><loc_47><loc_349><loc_249><loc_449>HYDRA defined neurostructural Subtypes using the z-scored regional volumetric values as input while adjusting for covariates such as age, Gender, and race. Following previous studies that used this approach, we evaluated multiple clustering solutions to identify the optimal number of clusters. Specifically, we tested clusters ranging from 2 to 8, with the goal of selecting the most stable solution. Stability was quantified primarily using the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) [42], calculated through eightfold cross-validation. A high ARI value indicates a robust and reproducible clustering solution. The solution with the highest ARI value was selected for subsequent analyses. To further evaluate</text>
<text><loc_255><loc_213><loc_457><loc_282>cluster structure, we supplemented ARI with two widely used internal validation metrics which are the Silhouette coefficient and the Calinski-Harabasz Index (CHI). A higher CHI indicates better-defined cluster structure with greater between-cluster dispersion relative to within-cluster compactness. Similarly, the Silhouette coefficient reflects the degree of separation between clusters, with higher values indicating greater distinctiveness.</text>

We examined baseline MMSE scores to evaluate overall cognitive status and used them as an outcome to compare between the identified subtypes.</text>

A comprehensive longitudinal analysis was performed evaluating memory, language, verbal, and executive function to compare trajectories over time. For each neuropsychological assessment and clinical test (e.g., MMSE and CDR Sum of Boxes), we employed mixed-effects models [52] to account for individual variability and the non-independence of repeated measurements within participants, allowing us to track cognitive impairment progression.

<text><loc_255><loc_115><loc_457><loc_238>HYDRA clustered patients based on regional brain volumes after adjusting for covariates (e.g. age, sex etc.). Evaluation of cluster stability using eightfold cross-validation exhibited a well-defined peak at K = 2 (see Fig. 2, the peak ARI value), indicating the existence of two highly reproducible subtypes (ARI = 0.552) within memory clinic patients. In addition to the ARI, we examined internal cluster validity using the Silhouette coefficient and CHI (see Supplementary Figure S2.). Both metrics supported the selection of two clusters as optimal. Specifically, the CH index peaked at K = 2 and declined steadily with additional clusters, indicating that the two-cluster solution provided the best separation relative to withincluster compactness. Similarly, the Silhouette coefficient was highest at K = 2, suggesting strong clustering quality in terms of compactness and distinctness.</text>

<text><loc_47><loc_306><loc_248><loc_405>Upon identifying two stable subtypes of memory clinic patient, we sought to understand which regional volumetric features drove this clustering result. The results revealed distinct neuroanatomical patterns of atrophy for the two subtypes compared to the CU controls (see Fig. 3). Subtype 1 exhibited relatively subtle atrophy, with low effect sizes throughout much of the temporal lobe and precuneus and was therefore termed the Temporal-Sparing Atrophy Subtype (TSA) Subtype. In contrast, Subtype 2 demonstrated more widespread atrophy, particularly in the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes, and was therefore termed the Temporal-Parietal Predominated Atrophy (TPPA) Subtype.</text>

While there was substantial overlap in age ranges among both subtypes, the TPPA Subtype had a slightly higher mean and median age than the TSA Subtype. Consequently, the two atrophy subtypes exhibited statistically significant differences in age distribution.

Consistent with the main findings from the full sample, the TPPA Subtype showed faster decline across most domains (i.e., negative difference in rate of change). The exception was Verbal Fluency, where the TSA Subtype showed slightly worse trajectories, replicating the paradox noted in the primary analysis. As expected, the Short Blessed score (where higher values indicate worse performance) exhibited a positive difference, indicating a steeper rate of decline in the TPPA Subtype. Notably, the Short Blessed Test showed considerable variability across bootstrap iterations. This widespread likely reflects multiple contributing factors, including the smaller number of repeated observations, the relatively coarse scoring structure of the instrument, and its limited sensitivity to subtle longitudinal change. Given its primary role as a screening tool rather than a nuanced progression measure, the broader distribution is expected. Nonetheless, the overall directionality of subtype differences remained preserved.</text>

<text><loc_47><loc_123><loc_248><loc_207>The differential decline rates between the subtypes may reflect underlying differences in neurobiological processes. The extensive atrophy observed in the TPPA Subtype suggests greater involvement of networks critical for executive function and memory, such as the frontoparietal and default mode networks. This may explain the faster cognitive deterioration and broader functional impairments in this group. Conversely, the TSA Subtype's slower progression might be attributed to the preservation of critical neural pathways, potentially delaying the onset of severe impairments.</text>
<text><loc_47><loc_207><loc_248><loc_366>In addition to structural and cognitive differences, we observed a significant disparity in vascular burden between subtypes. The TPPA Subtype exhibited higher T1-derived WMH volumes, suggesting greater vascular risk in this group. This vascular burden may compound the effects of neurodegeneration and contribute to the accelerated clinical progression seen in the TPPA Subtype. Importantly, because our clustering was based solely on normalized gray matter measures that directly capture neurodegeneration and can be widely obtained in clinical MRI, WMH differences were not part of the model input but instead represent an additional biological dimension that may interact with atrophy patterns. It supports the idea that subtype-specific disease trajectories may arise from a combination of neurodegenerative and vascular mechanisms. Collectively, these findings align with the hypothesis [59] that neurodegenerative processes can follow distinct pathways depending on the affected neural circuits, further highlighting the importance of stratified research into neurodegenerative mechanisms.</text>

<text><loc_255><loc_84><loc_457><loc_238>The longitudinal analyses and the sensitivity tests revealed that cognitive decline does not follow a uniform trajectory across the dementia spectrum but varies significantly between the subtypes identified. Incorporating mixed-effects models allowed us to capture the nuances of how age and disease duration impact cognitive decline. These models indicated that the cognitive trajectory in the TPPA Subtype is steeper, aligning with its broader anatomical impact, while the TSA Subtype experienced a more gradual decline, consistent with its relatively low effect sizes in temporal regions and the precuneus, areas critical for memory processing and episodic recall. Interestingly, the Verbal Fluency Test results in the TSA Subtype, which were worse than those in the TPPA Subtype, point to a domain-specific vulnerability that stands apart from the otherwise milder pattern of global decline. This suggests that even "less aggressive" atrophy profiles may disproportionately affect certain cognitive circuits supporting lexical retrieval and language production, warranting hypothesis-driven investigation in future studies.</text>
<text><loc_255><loc_238><loc_457><loc_366>Complementing these cognitive findings, we also examined global clinical progression using longitudinal changes in CDR-Sum of Boxes and MMSE, as well as Cox proportional hazards survival models restricted to individuals with baseline CDR = 0.5. Notably, none of these global metrics revealed significant differences in progression rates between subtypes. This apparent dissociation between cognitive test decline and global clinical staging suggests that while the TPPA subtype exhibits more rapid domain-specific deterioration, such changes may not be fully captured by global staging tools like the CDR within the available follow-up window. These findings underscore the limitations of global clinical scales in reflecting the nuanced progression patterns of biologically distinct subtypes and highlight the need for more sensitive or domain-specific outcome measures in memory clinic cohorts.</text>

<text><loc_47><loc_70><loc_249><loc_245>In parallel, our findings underscore the power of machine-learning methods, particularly semi-supervised algorithms like HYDRA, in parsing hidden heterogeneity. Unlike traditional classification models that assume a single disease pattern, HYDRA leverages multiple "margins" to identify unique atrophy profiles within a clinically diverse cohort. This approach is especially beneficial in real-world memory clinics, where patients may have a range of pathologies and disease trajectories beyond a single, canonical syndrome. Beyond simply detecting subtypes, machine learning (ML)-driven analyses can illuminate the specific neuroanatomical markers that differentiate these subgroups, guiding clinicians toward more nuanced and data-driven diagnostic insights. Nevertheless, the clinical utility of such clustering hinges upon robust validation, both biologically (e.g., with pathology biomarkers) and clinically (e.g., through longitudinal functional outcomes). As multimodal datasets become more common, ongoing advances in machinelearning algorithms will help integrate imaging, fluid, genetic, and functional data, further supporting more granular models of dementia progression and informing future translational research.</text>
<section_header_level_1><loc_47><loc_251><loc_85><loc_259>Limitations</section_header_level_1>
<text><loc_47><loc_259><loc_249><loc_443>While this study provides significant insights into the heterogeneity of dementia, several limitations must be acknowledged. First, because AD is the most common cause of dementia, having biomarker data for PET imaging, genetic markers, or fluid biomarkers would be critical for confirming or excluding AD pathology in our cohort [60]. However, the OASIS-4 dataset does not provide these biomarkers, which limits our ability to ascertain whether the identified subtypes map directly onto AD or other neurodegenerative processes. This constraint may affect the precision of our subtype classification and the overall robustness of our findings. Moreover, as our clustering approach relied on single modality design (i.e., T1-weighted structural MRI), the resulting subtypes capture dominant anatomical variation but may lack the sensitivity to differentiate Alzheimer's disease from other non-AD pathologies Such as frontotemporal lobar degeneration, vascular dementia, or mixed etiologies. Although HYDRA is designed to capture dominant neuroanatomical axes of variation, the lack of multimodal data restricts our ability to resolve overlapping atrophy patterns that may arise from distinct underlying mechanisms. Lastly, although approximately 10% of participants were African American, this remains</text>

<text><loc_255><loc_206><loc_457><loc_276>This study underscores the critical importance of addressing heterogeneity in clinical cohorts for understanding neurodegenerative diseases. By applying the HYDRA algorithm to the OASIS-4 dataset, we identified two distinct subtypes of memory clinic populations based on neuroanatomical atrophy patterns and cognitive decline trajectories. These subtypes highlight the substantial variability in clinical presentations, reflecting the diversity seen in real-world clinical settings.</text>
<text><loc_255><loc_275><loc_457><loc_351>The TSA Subtype, characterized by more localized atrophy and slower cognitive decline, represents a less aggressive form of dementia, potentially offering a larger window for early intervention. In contrast, the TPPA Subtype, with widespread atrophy and faster cognitive decline, underscores the need for more intensive clinical management. These findings demonstrate the value of recognizing and analyzing heterogeneity within clinical cohorts, moving beyond traditional one-size-fits-all approaches.</text>
<text><loc_255><loc_350><loc_457><loc_435>Importantly, although clear subtype differences were observed in domain-specific cognitive trajectories, these did not consistently translate into differences in global clinical progression as captured by summary metrics such as CDR or MMSE. This dissociation highlights the limitations of relying solely on global staging tools to track disease progression in memory clinic populations. Future efforts should prioritize more sensitive and domain-specific measures to better capture the true extent and variability of cognitive decline across distinct subtypes.</text>
