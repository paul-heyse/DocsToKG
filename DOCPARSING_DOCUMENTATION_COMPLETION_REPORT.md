## Detailed Updates

### 1. `core/manifest_sink.py`

**Before:**
```
Unified manifest sink for DocParsing stages.

This module provides a protocol and implementation for writing stage manifest
entries (success, skip, failure) with atomic, lock-based JSONL appending.
All stages use this abstraction to ensure consistent base fields and
reliable concurrent writes.
```

**After:**
```
Unified manifest sink for DocParsing stages.

This module provides a protocol and implementation for writing stage manifest
entries (success, skip, failure) with atomic, lock-aware JSONL appending using
the lock-aware JsonlWriter component from io.py.

All stages use this abstraction to ensure consistent base fields and reliable
concurrent writes even when multiple processes report progress simultaneously.
The implementation leverages FileLock and atomic appends to prevent manifest
corruption during concurrent access, making it safe for distributed pipelines.

Key components:
- ManifestSink: Protocol defining the manifest writing interface
- JsonlManifestSink: Implementation using atomic JSONL appends
- ManifestEntry: Dataclass for individual entries

All writes are atomic and process-safe, suitable for distributed pipelines
where multiple workers may write concurrently.
```

**Changes:**
- Referenced JsonlWriter component explicitly
- Mentioned FileLock implementation detail
- Added "distributed pipelines" use case
- Listed key components with descriptions

### 2. `chunking/runtime.py`

**Before:**
```
Docling Hybrid Chunker with Minimum Token Coalescence

Transforms DocTags documents into chunked records with topic-aware coalescence.
The module exposes a CLI (``python -m DocsToKG.DocParsing.core chunk``)
and reusable helpers for other pipelines.

Key Features:
- Token-aware chunk merging that respects structural boundaries and image metadata.
- Shared CLI configuration via :func:`DocsToKG.DocParsing.doctags.add_data_root_option`.
- Manifest logging that records chunk counts, parsing engines, and durations.
...
```

**After:**
```

Concurrency & Durability:
- Chunk JSONL written atomically via JsonlWriter for concurrent-safe appending.
- Manifest entries written atomically to prevent corruption under parallel loads.
- Process-safe locking ensures reliable multi-worker pipelines.
...
```

**Changes:**
- Added atomic write features to key features

```
Atomic Parquet Writer for Chunks

Encapsulates write logic for Chunks Parquet datasets with:

- Parquet footer metadata for provenance
- Deterministic span hashing
- Manifest integration helpers
```

**After:**
```
Atomic Parquet Writer for Chunks

Encapsulates write logic for Chunks Parquet datasets with:
- Schema validation and enforcement
- Atomic writes (temp → fsync → rename) for safe concurrent access
  * Write to temporary file in same directory
  * Fsync to ensure durability
  * Atomic rename to final destination (no explicit locking needed; rename is atomic at OS level)
  * Concurrent readers are safe via temp-file pattern
- Batched row accumulation to control memory
- Parquet footer metadata for provenance
- Deterministic span hashing for reproducible chunks

Key Class:
- `ParquetChunksWriter`: Writes Chunks datasets with optional rolling.

All writes are safe for concurrent access and preserve data durability.
```

**Changes:**
- Detailed atomic write mechanism with sub-bullets
- Clarified that rename is atomic (no explicit locking needed)
- Explained concurrent reader safety
- Added durability guarantee statement
- Removed vague "manifest integration helpers" reference

All modules that use atomic writes, concurrent access, or locking mechanisms now clearly document:
- The mechanism employed (safe_write(), JsonlWriter, or OS-level atomicity)
- Why it's needed (concurrent safety, durability)
- How it works (lock patterns, file operations)
- What guarantees it provides (process-safe, atomic, idempotent)

**Status:** ✅ **READY FOR PRODUCTION**
