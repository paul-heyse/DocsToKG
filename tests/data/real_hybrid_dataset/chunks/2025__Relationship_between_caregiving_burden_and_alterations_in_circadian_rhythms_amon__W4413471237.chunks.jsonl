Caregiving burden is known to cause health issues in caregivers, including depression [\n5\n,\n6\n], cognitive decline [\n7\n,\n8\n,\n9\n,\n10\n], cardiovascular disease [\n10\n,\n11\n], and sleep disturbance [\n11\n,\n12\n,\n13\n,\n14\n]. These effects can be devastating because the primary caregivers of individuals with dementia are often a spouse caregiver (SCG) [\n15\n].\nAlthough most of existing literature has focused on sleep disturbances such as reduced sleep duration or poor sleep quality in caregivers [\n11\n,\n12\n,\n13\n,\n14\n], there is also interest in alteration in circadian rhythm such as sleep-wake cycle [\n16\n] and rest-activity rhythm (RAR) [\n17\n,\n18\n], which may provide a more comprehensive understanding of caregivers' behavioral or physiological functions. Disruption of circadian rhythms was also linked to other health problems. For example, changes in RARs, such as lower amplitude, less robust rhythms, and delayed peak activity times, have been associated with transition to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia in older adults [\n19\n], and delayed phases in RARs have been related to depression in older adults [\n20\n]. Additionally, it has been reported that the risk of cardiovascular disease was associated with changes in the sleep-wake cycle [\n21\n]. Thus, there is a correlation between negative health outcomes due to caregiving burden and circadian rhythm disruption. Therefore, it is essential to understand the alterations of circadian rhythm that arise from SCGs' caregiving burden.\nMost studies on circadian rhythm changes in SCGs have focused on changes in the sleep-wake cycle and have been limited to subjective assessments using self-report questionnaires, such as the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) [\n22\n]. These studies' methods rely on self-reported assessments that are influenced by factors such as emotional state and subjective experience, thereby may limit the ability to determine circadian rhythm changes' exact pattern [\n23\n,\n24\n].", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/54", "#/texts/55", "#/texts/56", "#/texts/57", "#/texts/58", "#/texts/59", "#/texts/60", "#/texts/61", "#/texts/62", "#/texts/63", "#/texts/64", "#/texts/65", "#/texts/66", "#/texts/67", "#/texts/68", "#/texts/69", "#/texts/70", "#/texts/71", "#/texts/72", "#/texts/73", "#/texts/74", "#/texts/75", "#/texts/76", "#/texts/77", "#/texts/78", "#/texts/79", "#/texts/80", "#/texts/81", "#/texts/82", "#/texts/83", "#/texts/84", "#/texts/85", "#/texts/86", "#/texts/87", "#/texts/88", "#/texts/89", "#/texts/90", "#/texts/91", "#/texts/92", "#/texts/93", "#/texts/94", "#/texts/95", "#/texts/96", "#/texts/97", "#/texts/98", "#/texts/99", "#/texts/100", "#/texts/101", "#/texts/102", "#/texts/103", "#/texts/104", "#/texts/105", "#/texts/106", "#/texts/107", "#/texts/108", "#/texts/109", "#/texts/110", "#/texts/111", "#/texts/112", "#/texts/113", "#/texts/114", "#/texts/115", "#/texts/116"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "f856476f-764c-48e8-adb0-67f7dc5fb7c6"}

Among these, actigraphy is easier to use than other methods and has been used in many studies on circadian rhythms [\n27\n,\n28\n]. For example, Fitbit devices objectively estimate sleep patterns [\n29\n,\n30\n], and Heart rate data, including circadian rhythms of heart rate (CHR), can be obtained using photoplethysmography sensors embedded in the device [\n31\n,\n32\n]. CHR could complement behavioral indicators of circadian rhythms by providing insight into autonomic nervous systems function [\n33\n]. Although different from the traditional RAR, CHR is derived from physiological rhythms and serves as an indirect behavioral indicator of the circadian rhythm system, reflecting physical activity and rest patterns [\n34\n,\n35\n]. Despite these advantages, there are limited studies on SCGs using actigraphy such as Fitbit to measure their circadian rhythms.\nBased on existing evidence linking caregiver burden with circadian rhythm dysregulation, we investigated whether increased caregiving burden would be associated with alterations in circadian rhythm among SCGs. Specifically, we assessed whether caregiving burden was associated with changes in sleep-wake cycles and CHR. Sleep-wake cycles were measured using both Fitbit (objective) and PSQI (subjective), while CHR was derived solely from Fitbit data. Given the limited prior research using objective tools to examine sleep-wake cycles and CHR in SCGs, we broadly examined multiple circadian rhythm parameters to identify those most sensitive to higher caregiving burden.\nGiven the limited prior research using objective tools for these circadian rhythms of SCG, rather than focusing on a single marker, we examined multiple circadian rhythm parameters to identify which features may be particularly sensitive to higher caregiving burden. In addition, considering previous studies showing sex-based [\n1\n] and care recipient diagnosis [\n36\n] differences in caregiving burden, we further assessed whether these variables moderated the observed association.

We found that greater caregiving burden was significantly associated with reduced circadian rhythm regularity of heart rate, as reflected by lower GoF in CHR. In addition, caregiving burden was related to greater subjective sleep disturbance and, although not statistically significant, showed a tendency toward earlier awakening, particularly among SCGs of individuals with dementia.\nAmong the investigated circadian rhythm parameters, GoF was the only indicator significantly associated with caregiving burden. GoF reflects the overall regularity of circadian rhythms, with lower values indicating a more disorganized or unstable rhythm pattern [\n46\n]. This finding suggests that caregiving stress may disrupt the general organization of physiological rhythms rather than affecting specific parameters such as acrophase or amplitude. This is consistent with prior RAR-based studies, which reported that caregivers who are unable to leave individuals with dementia alone often experience frequent nighttime awakenings, potentially contributing to rhythm fragmentation [\n18\n]. However, unlike those findings-where MESOR was also affected-our results suggest that caregiving burden may primarily influence rhythm regularity. This difference may reflect the nature of CHR, which captures not only behavioral rhythms, but also internal physiological stress responses mediated by autonomic regulation [\n33\n,\n34\n,\n35\n].", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/257", "#/texts/258", "#/texts/259", "#/texts/260", "#/texts/261", "#/texts/262", "#/texts/263", "#/texts/264", "#/texts/265", "#/texts/266", "#/texts/267", "#/texts/268"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "e7e4ca98-5428-4ec6-8448-513a5553b269"}

This may reflect the tendency of these caregivers to wake up early and struggle to return to sleep due to care recipients' nocturnal behaviors [\n47\n]. This multifactorial interaction may help explain why the trend toward earlier awakening was more pronounced in this subgroup. However, prior studies suggest that such disruptions are not solely attributable to the care recipient but also caregivers' factors [\n12\n,\n47\n,\n48\n,\n49\n]. In our study, SCGs reported poorer subjective sleep quality despite sufficient sleep duration, as indicated by higher PSQI global and subdomain scores (excluding sleep duration) compared to cognitively healthy older adults in Korea [\n50\n], as well as a positive association between caregiving burden and subjective sleep disturbance. This finding contrasts with that of Ryuno et al. [\n14\n], who reported a significant association between caregiving burden and reduced sleep duration. One possible explanation for this discrepancy is the use of different devices: the ActiGraph GT9X used in Ryuno's study is known to underestimate sleep duration, whereas Fitbit has shown greater concordance with PSG in detecting sleep parameters [\n51\n]. Additionally, the caregivers in our study were older (mean age: 70.2 vs. 66.9 years) and had higher PSQI scores (8.25\u2009\u00b1\u20093.56 vs. 5.2\u2009\u00b1\u20093.6), suggesting greater baseline sleep disturbance that may have masked any association between caregiving burden and sleep duration. Although neither result reached statistical significance, Fitbit data showed a trend toward earlier awakening, and PSQI responses indicated longer sleep latency with increasing caregiving burden. These discrepancies may reflect differences in assessment tools, or the varied ways in which caregiving stress manifests in individual sleep patterns. For instance, caregivers often manage dual responsibilities (e.g., medication schedules, hospital visits), which may delay sleep onset [\n12\n], while nighttime vigilance or anticipatory anxiety may lead to earlier awakening [\n47\n].", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/269", "#/texts/270", "#/texts/271", "#/texts/272", "#/texts/273", "#/texts/274", "#/texts/275", "#/texts/276", "#/texts/277", "#/texts/278", "#/texts/279", "#/texts/280", "#/texts/281", "#/texts/282", "#/texts/283", "#/texts/284", "#/texts/285", "#/texts/286", "#/texts/287", "#/texts/288", "#/texts/289"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "d77662b2-be3c-413b-82a3-9dd67952eff9"}

More critically, it is not the specific timing (e.g., waking early or sleeping late) that may matter most, but rather the disruption in regularity. Additionally, such disruptions may persist even after care recipients' nocturnal behaviors improve, implying that alterations in caregivers' circadian regulation may become chronic [\n47\n]. Therefore, when assessing SCGs' sleep problems, it is crucial to consider other aspects of sleep quality beyond sleep duration. Specifically, given our results, examining the robustness of circadian rhythms in caregivers with a high caregiving burden may be particularly beneficial.\nAlterations in circadian rhythms have been associated with depression [\n18\n] and cognitive decline in caregivers [\n19\n]. Disruptions to the circadian system can impact cardiovascular health independently of behavioral and environmental cycles [\n11\n,\n21\n]. These disruptions are important because they can cause serious practical problems for caregivers, such as caregivers failing to recognize new symptoms, forgetting to administer medication, being unable to multitask, and struggling to make rational decisions [\n12\n]. Studies have shown that circadian rhythm alterations in caregivers can be improved with appropriate sleep interventions, thus highlighting the importance of early intervention [\n12\n,\n14\n].", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/290", "#/texts/291", "#/texts/292", "#/texts/293", "#/texts/294", "#/texts/295", "#/texts/296", "#/texts/297", "#/texts/298", "#/texts/299", "#/texts/300", "#/texts/301", "#/texts/302", "#/texts/303", "#/texts/304", "#/texts/305", "#/texts/306", "#/texts/307"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "f7d78f2f-db9e-4924-93fd-e6bd796a7fda"}

While CHR is distinct from traditional RAR, it provides unique physiological insights into circadian regulation by primarily reflecting autonomic nervous system activity, thereby complementing behavioral indicators [\n33\n,\n34\n,\n35\n]. Moreover, we assessed multiple circadian rhythm variables, including those derived from both sleep-wake cycles and CHR. Although not all variables showed statistically significant associations, the consistent directionality and conceptual coherence of the findings support the relevance of the selected domains to caregiving burden.\nDespite these strengths, several limitations should be acknowledged. Although vascular risk factors were assessed and statistically controlled for, we did not collect detailed information on medications that may affect heart rate, such as beta-blockers, which remains a clear limitation. Furthermore, the absence of heart rate variability (HRV) analysis is notable. The Fitbit device used in this study does not provide access to raw inter-beat interval data through its API, offering only summary-level HRV metrics during sleep periods [\n52\n]. This restricted our ability to examine autonomic nervous system activity in more depth. Future studies employing devices capable of high-resolution inter-beat interval recording could allow for a more comprehensive assessment of caregivers' autonomic and circadian profiles. Additionally, we did not account for non-circadian factors that may influence circadian rhythms, such as voluntary physical activity or lifestyle habits. The relatively small sample size and the inclusion of SCGs of individuals who were CN may also limit the generalizability of the findings. For the interaction analysis, these participants were grouped with non-dementia care recipients group. But the subgroup of SCGs of individuals with CN was particularly small (\nn\n=\u20095). While this grouping supported statistical feasibility, comparisons between SCGs of individuals with dementia and without dementia should be interpreted with caution. Lastly, the study may be subject to selection bias, as participants were recruited from a single geriatric psychiatric clinic. This may limit the applicability of the findings to other settings or more diverse caregiving populations.", "doc_items_refs": ["#/texts/309", "#/texts/310", "#/texts/311", "#/texts/312", "#/texts/313", "#/texts/314", "#/texts/315", "#/texts/316", "#/texts/317", "#/texts/318", "#/texts/319", "#/texts/320"], "page_nos": [], "uuid": "f2d56652-c2f9-448a-a243-108d2d5d25ae"}

This suggests that caregiving stress may contribute to disruptions in the stability of physiological rhythms. Higher caregiving burden was also associated with greater subjective sleep disturbance. While offset time showed a non-significant trend, especially among SCGs of individuals with dementia, no other circadian parameters demonstrated notable associations. These findings underscore the potential value of GoF as an objective indicator of circadian rhythm disruption in caregivers.
