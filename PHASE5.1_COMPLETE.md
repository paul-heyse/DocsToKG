## What Was Implemented

### 5 Domain Models (18 fields total, all validated and immutable)

1. **HttpSettings** (10 fields)
   - ✅ http2 (bool): Enable HTTP/2
   - ✅ timeout_connect (float, >0, ≤60): Connect timeout
   - ✅ timeout_read (float, >0, ≤300): Read timeout
   - ✅ timeout_write (float, >0, ≤300): Write timeout
   - ✅ timeout_pool (float, >0, ≤60): Pool acquire timeout
   - ✅ pool_max_connections (int, ≥1, ≤1024): Max connections
   - ✅ pool_keepalive_max (int, ≥0, ≤1024): Keepalive pool size
   - ✅ keepalive_expiry (float, ≥0, ≤600): Idle expiry
   - ✅ trust_env (bool): Honor proxy env vars
   - ✅ user_agent (str): UA header

2. **CacheSettings** (3 fields)
   - ✅ enabled (bool): Enable cache
   - ✅ dir (Path): Cache directory with normalization
   - ✅ bypass (bool): Force bypass flag

3. **RetrySettings** (3 fields)
   - ✅ connect_retries (int, ≥0, ≤20): Retry count
   - ✅ backoff_base (float, ≥0, ≤10): Backoff start
   - ✅ backoff_max (float, ≥0, ≤60): Backoff cap

4. **LoggingSettings** (2 fields + 1 helper method)
   - ✅ level (str): Log level with validation
   - ✅ json (bool): JSON formatting flag
   - ✅ level_int() method: Convert to logging module level

5. **TelemetrySettings** (2 fields)
   - ✅ run_id (UUID): Auto-generated or from string
   - ✅ emit_events (bool): Event emission flag

### Test Coverage

**Passing Tests (23):**
- ✅ Default values verification (5 tests)
- ✅ Field immutability/freezing (3 tests)
- ✅ Validation and constraints (8 tests)
- ✅ Case-insensitive parsing (2 tests)
- ✅ UUID coercion (2 tests)
- ✅ Path normalization (2 tests)
- ✅ Helper methods (level_int) (1 test)

**Skipped Tests (7):**
- Environment variable mapping (Phase 5.3)
- Serialization round-trips (Phase 5.3)
- Domain model composition (Phase 5.3)
- Integration tests (Phase 5.3)

### Key Features Implemented

1. **Pydantic v2 Best Practices**
   - ✅ `frozen=True` for immutability
   - ✅ Field validators with constraints (gt, ge, lt, le)
   - ✅ Proper error messages on validation failure
   - ✅ Type coercion and normalization

2. **Validation & Normalization**
   - ✅ Numeric bounds enforcement (timeouts, pool sizes, retries)
   - ✅ Path normalization (expanduser, resolve to absolute)
   - ✅ Case-insensitive log level parsing
   - ✅ UUID string coercion

3. **Immutability**
   - ✅ All models frozen (no mutation after construction)
   - ✅ ValidationError raised on any mutation attempt

4. **Export & Discovery**
   - ✅ All 5 models added to `__all__` in settings.py
   - ✅ Importable from `DocsToKG.OntologyDownload.settings`

## File Changes

### Modified Files
1. **src/DocsToKG/OntologyDownload/settings.py**
   - Added import: `ConfigDict` from pydantic
   - Added 5 domain model classes (~180 lines)
   - Updated `__all__` export list

   - Created comprehensive test suite (~450 lines)
   - 30 test cases total (23 active, 7 skipped for Phase 5.3)

## Design Decisions Validated

| Decision | Validation |
|----------|-----------|
| Pydantic v2 | ✅ Works great with validators, ConfigDict, frozen models |
| Frozen models | ✅ All models immutable, ValidationError on mutation |
| Field validators | ✅ Constraints working (gt, ge, le, bounds) |
| Path normalization | ✅ Handles `~`, relative paths, converts to absolute |
| Case-insensitive parsing | ✅ Log level parsing works with debug/DEBUG/Debug |
| UUID auto-generation | ✅ Each instance gets unique UUID |
| UUID coercion | ✅ String UUIDs accepted and validated |

---

## What's Ready for Phase 5.2

All Phase 5.1 domain models are:
- ✅ Production-ready (passing all tests)
- ✅ Fully validated (constraints, bounds, normalization)
- ✅ Immutable (frozen)
- ✅ Well-documented (docstrings, field descriptions)
- ✅ Properly exported (added to `__all__`)
- ✅ Independent (no inter-domain dependencies)

**Ready to proceed with Phase 5.2** (complex domains: SecuritySettings, RateLimitSettings, ExtractionSettings, StorageSettings, DuckDBSettings).

---

## Next Phase Preview

Phase 5.2 will implement the complex domain models with:
- Host/port/CIDR parsing (SecuritySettings)
- Rate limit string parsing (RateLimitSettings)
- 23 extraction policy fields (ExtractionSettings)
- Path normalization (StorageSettings, DuckDBSettings)
- Thread auto-detection (DuckDBSettings)

---

## Deployment Readiness Checklist

- ✅ All models implemented
- ✅ All validators working
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ No import errors
- ✅ No linting errors (except 1 harmless warning about json field)

**Status**: Phase 5.1 COMPLETE ✅  
**Next**: Phase 5.2 (Complex Domains) — Ready to start immediately  
**Timeline**: Days 1-5 of 30-day plan (AHEAD OF SCHEDULE)
