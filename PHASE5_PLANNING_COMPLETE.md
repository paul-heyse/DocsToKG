## The Plan Covers

### âœ… Scope (Complete)

- [x] 10 domain sub-models (HTTP, Cache, Retry, Security, RateLimit, Extraction, Storage, DuckDB, Logging, Telemetry)
- [x] 50+ configuration fields with types, defaults, validation rules

- [x] Environment variable specification (ONTOFETCH_* with nested __ delimiter)
- [x] Validation and normalization logic (early, once at load)
- [x] Helper methods for consumers (rate parsing, host normalization, glob filters, etc.)

### âœ… Architecture (Complete)

- [x] Pydantic v2 + pydantic-settings for typed configuration
- [x] Domain decomposition (separation of concerns, reusability, clarity)
- [x] Singleton getter with LRU caching (efficient re-access)

- [x] Fixture patterns (temp_env, settings_from_dict, cleanup)
- [x] File structure (11 new test files, 7 modified modules)

### âœ… Risk Mitigation (Complete)

- [x] 5 identified risks (circular imports, thread safety, performance, breaking changes, validation strictness)
- [x] Severity assessment (MEDIUM, MEDIUM, LOW, HIGH, MEDIUM)
- [x] Specific mitigations for each (lazy imports, lru_cache, profiling, backward-compat tests, lenient defaults)

### âœ… Documentation (Complete)

- [x] Environment variable matrix (all 50+ fields with types, defaults, descriptions)

## Key Design Decisions (Justified)

| Decision | Why | Trade-off Accepted |
|----------|-----|-------------------|
| Pydantic v2 | Speed (Rust), features (computed fields), ecosystem (pydantic-settings) | Older libraries on Python 3.7 not supported (acceptable: we target 3.9+) |
| BaseSettings | Built-in env loading, dotenv, source precedence hooks | No magic (explicit is better, which is Pythonic) |
| 10 sub-models | Clarity, reusability, testability, extensibility | Slightly more code (worth it for maintainability) |
| Singleton `get()` | Cache expensive operations, testable, no global state | Requires cache clearing in tests (acceptable pattern) |
| Immutable models | Prevent bugs from mid-run mutations | No "update after load" (acceptable: build Settings once) |
| No secrets in hash | Prevent leaking API keys in logs/telemetry | Must track which fields are secrets (documented) |
| CSV parsing in env | Human-friendly config (no JSON needed) | Requires validator logic (well-specified) |
| Frozen models | Read-only after load | Can't use dataclass-like field mutation (acceptable) |

---

## Backward Compatibility: Zero Breaking Changes

### âœ… What Stays the Same

- All existing CLI commands work identically
- All existing public builder functions (e.g., `build_download_config()`) stay unchanged
- All existing function signatures unchanged
- All existing tests pass without modification
- All existing code continues to work

### âœ¨ What Changes (Internals Only)

- Settings loaded once via BaseSettings (instead of ad-hoc environment reads)
- Consumers read from typed sub-models (e.g., `s.http.timeout_connect`)
- All validation happens at load time (not repeatedly at use time)
- Tests can inject custom settings via fixtures (instead of mocking env vars)

---

## Success Metrics (from Plan)

After Phase 5 completes, the project will have:

- âœ… All 50+ fields implemented with proper validation
- âœ… 150-200 tests passing (>90% coverage)
- âœ… Source precedence verified
- âœ… Settings load in < 100ms (cached < 1Î¼s)
- âœ… Config hashing stable and reproducible
- âœ… All models frozen/immutable
- âœ… Zero breaking changes to public API
- âœ… Migration guide complete
- âœ… Documentation comprehensive
- âœ… Code review approved

## What's Ready to Start

3. RetrySettings (3 fields) â€” connect retries, backoff
4. LoggingSettings (2 fields) â€” level, JSON mode
5. TelemetrySettings (2 fields) â€” run ID, emit events
