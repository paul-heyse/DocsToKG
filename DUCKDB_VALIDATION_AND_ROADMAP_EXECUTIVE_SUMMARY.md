## WHAT'S MISSING: 7 CRITICAL GAPS

### üî¥ CRITICAL GAPS (Must Close)

**GAP 1: Boundaries NOT Called from planning.py** ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**
- Status: NOT INTEGRATED
- Impact: Downloads/extractions/validations NOT recorded in database
- Fix Time: 2.5 hours
- Scope: Wire 4 boundary functions into fetch_one()

**GAP 2: Storage Fa√ßade NOT Implemented**
- Status: NOT FOUND
- Impact: MEDIUM - No abstraction for storage operations
- Fix Time: 5-6 hours
- Scope: Create storage/base.py + storage/localfs_duckdb.py

### üü† HIGH PRIORITY GAPS (Should Close)

**GAP 3: CLI Commands Only 17% Complete** (1 of 6 commands)
- Status: PARTIAL
- Impact: HIGH - Operability, user-facing
- Fix Time: 2 hours
- Missing: files, stats, delta, doctor, prune, backup

**GAP 4: Observability Events Only ~40% Wired**
- Status: PARTIAL
- Impact: HIGH - Audit trail incomplete
- Fix Time: 2 hours
- Missing: Full event emission in boundaries + doctor/gc

**GAP 5: Integration Tests Missing**
- Status: NONE
- Impact: HIGH - Can't validate architecture
- Fix Time: 1.5 hours
- Scope: E2E tests for plan ‚Üí fetch ‚Üí extract ‚Üí boundary flow

### üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY GAPS (Nice to Have)

**GAP 6: Settings Integration Incomplete**
- Status: PARTIAL
- Impact: MEDIUM
- Fix Time: 1.5 hours

**GAP 7: Delta Macros/Views Completeness Unknown**
- Status: UNKNOWN
- Impact: MEDIUM
- Fix Time: 0.5 hours (audit)

## WHAT THIS MEANS FOR OPERATIONS

### Currently BROKEN:
- ‚ùå Doctor cannot work (no data about what's on disk)
- ‚ùå Prune cannot work (no version/artifact tracking)
- ‚ùå Latest pointer not maintained
- ‚ùå No audit trail of download/extract/validation

### Currently WORKING:
- ‚úÖ Schema is in place
- ‚úÖ Migrations run
- ‚úÖ Queries execute
- ‚úÖ Boundaries exist (but not called)

---

## PHASE 1 ROADMAP: 9 Hours to Full Integration

### Week 1 Tasks:

**Task 1.4: Settings (1.5 hrs)** ‚Üê START HERE
- Define DuckDBSettings + StorageSettings
- Wire into config_hash
- Foundation for everything else

**Task 1.2: CLI Commands (2 hrs)**
- Implement all 6 db subcommands
- For manual verification and operations

**Task 1.1: Wire Boundaries (2.5 hrs)** ‚Üê CRITICAL
- Integrate with planning.py
- Call boundaries after each operation
- Core fix for data tracking

**Task 1.3: Observability (2 hrs)**
- Add event emission to all boundaries
- Add event emission to doctor/prune
- Audit trail completeness

**Task 1.5: Tests (1.5 hrs)**
- E2E integration tests
- Doctor scenarios
- Prune scenarios
- Delta scenarios

---

## PHASE 2 ROADMAP: 6 Hours (Optional, Week 2)

**Task 2.1: Storage Fa√ßade (2 hrs)**
- Implement abstract StorageBackend protocol
- Document interface

**Task 2.2: LocalDuckDBStorage (3 hrs)**
- Atomic file operations
- Latest pointer integration

**Task 2.3: Wire Into Boundaries (1 hr)**
- Update boundaries to use storage interface

---

## SUCCESS METRICS

### After Phase 1 (Week 1):
- ‚úÖ Planning.py calls all 4 boundaries
- ‚úÖ All 6 CLI commands working
- ‚úÖ All events emitted with metadata
- ‚úÖ Settings wired into config_hash
- ‚úÖ 100% integration test pass rate
- ‚úÖ Zero linting violations

### After Phase 2 (Week 2):
- ‚úÖ Storage fa√ßade fully abstracted
- ‚úÖ LocalDuckDBStorage production-ready
- ‚úÖ Boundaries use storage interface
- ‚úÖ End-to-end integration complete

### Post-Implementation:
- üìä Doctor works: detects mismatches
- üßπ Prune works: reclaims disk space
- üìà Latest pointer: version tracking
- üìã Audit trail: all operations logged
- üîç Queryable catalog: answers operational questions
- üéØ Production-ready: fully tested + documented

---

## RISK ASSESSMENT

### Risks if NOT Implemented:
- **CRITICAL**: Doctor/Prune broken (can't maintain filesystem)
- **HIGH**: No audit trail (compliance issue)
- **HIGH**: No latest pointer (version mgmt broken)
- **HIGH**: No operational visibility

### Implementation Risks:
- **LOW**: Boundaries already exist (just need to be called)
- **LOW**: CLI mostly framework (queries ready)
- **LOW**: Tests straightforward (basic E2E patterns)
- **MEDIUM**: Settings wiring (need to trace config impact)

---

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### IMMEDIATE (Next 2 hours):
1. ‚úÖ Review audit document (DUCKDB_IMPLEMENTATION_AUDIT.md)
2. ‚úÖ Review implementation plan (DUCKDB_PHASE1_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)
3. üöÄ **Proceed with Phase 1 implementation** (Tasks 1.4 ‚Üí 1.2 ‚Üí 1.1 ‚Üí 1.3 ‚Üí 1.5)

### SHORT TERM (Week 1):
- Complete Phase 1 (9 hours)
- All 5 tasks implemented
- Full test coverage
- Production ready

### MEDIUM TERM (Week 2):
- Implement Phase 2 (6 hours)
- Storage fa√ßade complete
- Optional but recommended

### VERIFICATION:
- All tests passing (100%)
- Zero linting violations
- 100% type-safe
- Manual E2E verification
