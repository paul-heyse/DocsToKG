# Phase 1 Implementation - Final Summary

**Date:** October 21, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION  
**Approach:** Tenacity-Native with Feature Gates  
**Risk Level:** MINIMAL  
**Estimated Effort:** 6-8 hours

## The Vision

Transform ContentDownload error handling and rate limiting from reactive (respond to failures) to intelligent (predict and adapt).

**Two High-Impact Improvements:**

1. **Contextual Error Recovery**
   - Different operations have different retry strategies
   - DOWNLOAD: aggressive (critical), VALIDATE: defer (non-critical), RESOLVE: failover
   - Reduces latency, improves success rate, prevents cascade failures

2. **Per-Provider Rate Limit Learning**
   - Track consecutive 429s and recovery times per provider
   - Progressively reduce rate limits when provider signals congestion
   - Avoid cascading 429s, improve provider relationships, reduce wait times

---

## The Approach: Three-Layer Design

### Layer 1: Tenacity-Native Extensions (400 LOC)

**Why Tenacity?** Already in use, proven pattern, standard library approach.

#### Part A: Context-Aware Retry Predicates (150 LOC)
```
errors/tenacity_policies.py
├── OperationType enum (DOWNLOAD, VALIDATE, RESOLVE, EXTRACT, MANIFEST_FETCH)
├── _should_retry_on_429() factory → Tenacity predicate
├── _should_retry_on_timeout() factory → Tenacity predicate
└── create_contextual_retry_policy() → Retrying object
```

**Key Innovation:** Encode operation context into Tenacity predicates.
- Different 429 handling per operation
- Signal deferral/failover to caller (not raise exception)
- Leverages Tenacity's retry_if_* infrastructure

#### Part B: Learning via Tenacity Callbacks (200 LOC)
```
ratelimit/tenacity_learning.py
├── ProviderBehavior dataclass
│   ├── consecutive_429s (count)
│   ├── recovery_times (list, bounded)
│   └── applied_reduction_pct (float)
├── ProviderBehaviorTracker class
│   ├── on_retry() → called by Tenacity before_sleep
│   ├── on_success() → called by caller
│   ├── get_effective_limit() → config_limit * (1 - reduction%)
│   └── JSON persistence (optional)
└── create_learning_retry_policy() → Retrying object with before_sleep hook
```

**Key Innovation:** Use Tenacity's before_sleep callback for learning.
- Track 429s without separate manager
- Progressive reduction (10% → 20% → 30%)
- JSON persistence for cross-run learning

### Layer 2: Feature Gates (25 LOC)

**Why Feature Gates?** Maximum safety, instant rollback, A/B testing.

```
config/models.py
├── enable_contextual_retry: bool = False
├── enable_provider_learning: bool = False
└── provider_learning_path: Optional[Path] = None

args.py
├── --enable-contextual-retry (flag)
└── --enable-provider-learning (flag)

Environment Variables
├── DOCSTOKG_ENABLE_CONTEXTUAL_RETRY=1
└── DOCSTOKG_ENABLE_PROVIDER_LEARNING=1
```

**Key Benefit:** Existing behavior preserved, new behavior opt-in.

### Layer 3: Integration Points (50 LOC)

**Where it plugs in:**

```
orchestrator/runner.py
├── get_retry_policy()
│   ├── if enable_contextual_retry:
│   │   └── create_contextual_retry_policy()
│   └── else:
│       └── create_http_retry_policy()  [existing, proven]
└── get_rate_limiter()
    ├── if enable_provider_learning:
    │   └── attach ProviderBehaviorTracker
    └── else:
        └── use RateLimiterManager as-is

download.py
├── track 429s in learning tracker
└── call tracker.on_success() on success

pipeline.py
├── check tracker.get_effective_limit()
└── use reduced limit if learning enabled
```

---

## Why This Design Excels

### ✅ Simplicity
- **400 LOC added** (vs 850+ for separate classes)
- **Factory functions** (not complex state machines)
- **Pure predicates** (easy to test, reason about)

### ✅ Safety
- **Feature gates** (flip flag, no revert needed)
- **Backward compatible** (flags default OFF)
- **No architectural changes** (just extensions)

### ✅ Leverage
- **Uses Tenacity patterns** (RetryCallState, before_sleep, retry_if_*)
- **Uses existing rate limiter** (attach tracker, get_effective_limit)
- **Zero new dependencies** (httpx + Tenacity already present)

### ✅ Observability
- **Hooks into before_sleep_log()** (automatic telemetry)
- **CLI command** (--provider-learning-status)
- **JSON persistence** (cross-run learning)

### ✅ Testability
- **Mock ProviderBehaviorTracker** (inject for tests)
- **Conditional policy selection** (test both paths)
- **Stateless predicates** (pure functions)

## Deployment Strategy

### Phase 1: Code Deploy (Hour 0-6)
```
Deploy to production with flags DISABLED by default
  • Existing code: 100% unchanged
  • New code: Zero impact (behind flag)
  • Rollout time: Normal deployment
  • Risk: ZERO
```

### Phase 2: Development Testing (1-2 hours after deploy)
```
Developers enable features locally
  ./.venv/bin/python -m DocsToKG.ContentDownload.cli \
    --topic "test" \
    --enable-contextual-retry \
    --enable-provider-learning \
    --out runs/dev

Collect: latency, success rate, 429 patterns, CPU/memory
```

### Phase 3: Staging Validation (1-2 hours)
```
Enable in staging environment (production-like, no real users)
  export DOCSTOKG_ENABLE_CONTEXTUAL_RETRY=1
  export DOCSTOKG_ENABLE_PROVIDER_LEARNING=1
  
  (run full workload)

Monitor: 1-2 hours for baseline comparison
```

### Phase 4: Production Gradual Rollout
```
Option A: Opt-in user signaling
  Users run: --enable-contextual-retry
  
Option B: Background tasks only
  Non-critical operations use new policy
  
Option C: Subset of workers
  DOCSTOKG_ENABLE_CONTEXTUAL_RETRY=1 on 1% of pods
  
Then: Monitor 24+ hours for metrics
```

### Phase 5: Validation & Decision
```
After 24 hours:

Metrics are stable/improving?
  → KEEP ENABLED (document as stable)

Metrics degraded?
  → ROLLBACK (flip flag OFF)

Metrics uncertain?
  → KEEP MONITORING (24+ more hours)
  → Tuning advice: adjust percentages, timeouts
```
