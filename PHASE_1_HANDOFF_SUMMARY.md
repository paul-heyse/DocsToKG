## 🏗️ ARCHITECTURE DELIVERED

### Layer 1: CLI Commands (9 total)
```
db migrate      → Apply pending migrations
db latest       → Get/set version pointer  
db versions     → List all versions
db files        → List files in version
db stats        → Get version statistics
db delta        → Compare versions
db doctor       → Health checks
db prune        → Orphan removal
db backup       → Timestamped backups
```

All commands emit `begin/success/error` events.

### Layer 2: Observability (15+ helper functions)
```
emit_boundary_begin/success/error
emit_doctor_begin/issue_found/fixed/complete
emit_prune_begin/orphan_found/deleted
emit_cli_command_begin/success/error
emit_slow_operation
emit_slow_query
TimedOperation context manager
```

### Layer 3: Operations (17 instrumented functions)
```
Boundaries (4):    download, extraction, validation, latest
Doctor (2):        detect_drifts, generate_report
GC (2):            prune_by_retention, garbage_collect
CLI (9):           All 9 commands
```

### Layer 4: Database (DuckDB Transactional)
```
Boundaries execute atomically
Events emitted on commit/rollback
Full context correlation
Performance timing included
```

## 💡 KEY INNOVATIONS

### 1. Consistent Instrumentation Pattern
Every instrumented function follows the same pattern:
```python
def operation(...):
    emit_begin(...)
    start = time.time()
    try:
        # ... do work ...
        emit_success(...)
    except Exception as e:
        emit_error(...)
        raise
```

### 2. Context Correlation
All events maintain context through:
- `run_id` - Session identifier
- `config_hash` - Configuration fingerprint
- `artifact_id` / `version_id` - Resource identifiers
- `boundary` / `operation` - Operation type

### 3. Performance Monitoring
Durations tracked for:
- Boundary operations
- Doctor operations
- GC operations
- CLI commands
- Slow query detection

### 4. Error Handling
All operations safely handle exceptions:
- Errors emitted before re-raising
- Rollbacks triggered on failure
- Context preserved in error events
