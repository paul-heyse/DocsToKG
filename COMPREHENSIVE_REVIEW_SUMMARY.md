---

## Edge Cases Analysis

All identified edge cases are properly handled:

| Scenario | Handling | Result |
|----------|----------|--------|
| Empty directory | Early return | ✅ Safe |
| No orphans found | Initialize empty section | ✅ Correct |
| DB unavailable | Error logged, version pruning continues | ✅ Graceful |
| File already deleted | Check exists() before delete | ✅ Safe |
| Permission denied | Per-file error logging | ✅ Robust |
| Large directory | Lazy evaluation (rglob) | ✅ Efficient |
| Staging table | CREATE IF NOT EXISTS | ✅ Idempotent |
| Duplicate files | UNION ALL in query | ✅ Deduplicated |

---

## Performance Assessment

Estimated performance for typical operations:

| Operation | Time | Notes |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Database startup | ~50ms | One-time |
| Filesystem scan (10k files) | ~500-1000ms | Lazy iteration |
| Stage in database | ~50ms | Single transaction |
| Query orphans | ~20-50ms | Optimized DuckDB query |
| Delete files (100 orphans) | ~100-1000ms | Per-file based |
| **Total prune cycle** | **~1-10s** | Acceptable |

---

## Security Assessment

✅ **No SQL Injection Risks**: All queries parameterized
✅ **No Arbitrary Deletions**: Database-validated orphan list
✅ **Audit Trail**: All actions logged
✅ **Preview Mode**: Dry-run prevents accidental deletions
✅ **Error Containment**: Failures don't crash the command

---

## Legacy Code Analysis

### Findings

**No legacy orphan detection code found** - The orphan detection is a new feature, not replacing existing code.

### Code That Still Exists (Active, Not Legacy)

**1. `collect_version_metadata()` (manifests.py:355)**

- Status: Active and required
- Used for: Version enumeration in prune
- Future migration: Could move to database queries in Phase 4+
- Cannot remove: Needed for existing functionality

**2. `STORAGE.delete_version()` (cli.py:1113)**

- Status: Active and required
- Used for: Version directory cleanup
- Future integration: Could integrate with database in Phase 6
- Cannot remove: Part of existing prune mechanism

### Recommendation

No decommissioning needed in current scope. Both functions serve important roles in existing prune functionality and are not redundant with new database layer.

### Short-term (Phase 4)

1. Implement plan/plan-diff caching using similar patterns
2. Add database query caching for frequently accessed metadata
3. Consider migrating `collect_version_metadata` to database

### Long-term (Phase 5-6)

1. Export database state for dashboards
2. Wire database into planning.py pipeline
3. Track orphan cleanup metrics
4. Enable trend analysis and reporting

## Appendix: Bug Fix Details

### Bug #1 Complete Analysis

**File**: `src/DocsToKG/OntologyDownload/cli.py` (lines 1224-1229)

**Description**: Exception handler in orphan detection didn't call `close_database()`

**Root Cause**: Exception handler path was missing cleanup code

**Fix Applied**:

```python
# Before (BUGGY):
except Exception as exc:
    orphans_section["error"] = str(exc)
    if logger is not None:
        logger.warning("orphan detection failed", extra={"error": str(exc)})
    # BUG: close_database() not called!

# After (FIXED):
except Exception as exc:
    orphans_section["error"] = str(exc)
    if logger is not None:
        logger.warning("orphan detection failed", extra={"error": str(exc)})
    try:
        close_database()  # NOW CALLED
    except Exception:
        pass  # Don't mask original exception
```

**Impact**: Prevents resource leak when orphan detection fails

**Verification**: Code compiles and imports successfully ✅
