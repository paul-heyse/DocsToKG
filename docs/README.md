## 3. Core Pipeline Overview

DocsToKG is composed of four coordinated pipelines that transform raw content into search-ready knowledge assets:

- **Content acquisition (`DocsToKG.ContentDownload`)** ‚Äì Resolves and downloads PDFs/HTML/XML using provider-specific resolver pipelines with polite rate limits, resumable manifests (JSONL + SQLite), and storage layout guidance. Outputs canonical artifact directories plus manifests enumerating every attempt.
- **Document parsing & enrichment (`DocsToKG.DocParsing`)** ‚Äì Converts documents into DocTags via Docling and vLLM-hosted Qwen models, chunkifies them with structural + token-aware heuristics, and generates dense (Qwen), sparse (SPLADE), and lexical features. Produces chunk/embedding JSONL files and stage manifests to support deterministic resume behaviour.
- **Ontology acquisition (`DocsToKG.OntologyDownload`)** ‚Äì Plans, downloads, and validates third-party ontologies (HP, GO, etc.) using hardened networking, checksum verification, and pluggable validators (ROBOT, rdflib, Arelle). Ensures ontology artifacts and lockfiles remain versioned and replayable for downstream ingestion.
- **Hybrid retrieval (`DocsToKG.HybridSearch`)** ‚Äì Loads DocParsing outputs into GPU-accelerated FAISS indexes, fuses dense and lexical scores (RRF + MMR), manages namespace routing/snapshots, and exposes synchronous search APIs with observability and diagnostics.

Cross-cutting conventions include manifest-driven idempotency (SHA-256 hashes, JSONL + SQLite indexes), environment-driven configuration (`DOCSTOKG_*`), documentation-first development, and GPU requirements for high-throughput DocTags/embedding and FAISS workloads.

## 4. Quick Start

1. **New to DocsToKG?** Start with [Overview](./01-overview/index.md) to understand what we do
2. **Ready to contribute?** Check [Development](./05-development/index.md) for guidelines
3. **Need to deploy?** See [Operations](./06-operations/index.md) for deployment guides
4. **Using the API?** Go directly to [API Reference](./04-api/index.md)

## 5. Documentation Standards

This documentation follows established standards for clarity and consistency:

- All content is written in Markdown for maximum compatibility
- API documentation is auto-generated from code comments using Sphinx
- Regular automated checks ensure documentation quality and link integrity
- All documentation is version-controlled alongside the codebase

## 6. Specifications & Processes

- **Documentation-first development** ‚Äì Update READMEs/AGENTS before landing behavioural changes; specs live under `openspec/` (e.g., [`openspec/project.md`](../openspec/project.md)) to capture goals, constraints, and architecture notes.
- **Style & annotation standards** ‚Äì Follow [`docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md`](./STYLE_GUIDE.md) and [`docs/CODE_ANNOTATION_STANDARDS.md`](./CODE_ANNOTATION_STANDARDS.md); NAVMAP headers at the top of modules keep navigation tools in sync.
- **Automated validation** ‚Äì Use `docs/scripts/validate_docs.py`, `check_links.py`, and `generate_all_docs.py` to keep documentation accurate; CI enforces linting (`ruff`), formatting (`black`, `isort`), typing (`mypy`), and tests (`pytest`).
- **Agent guardrails** ‚Äì Each package‚Äôs AGENTS guide outlines no-install expectations, canonical commands, troubleshooting paths, and performance objectives for AI-driven execution.
