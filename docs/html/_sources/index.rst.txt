Overview
--------

DocsToKG transforms documents into structured knowledge graphs that enable intelligent search, analysis, and discovery. Built on vector search technology (Faiss) and modern AI/ML frameworks, it provides:

* **Document Processing**: Extract and structure content from various document formats
* **Knowledge Graph Construction**: Build interconnected representations of document content
* **Intelligent Search**: Semantic search capabilities across document collections
* **API-First Design**: RESTful APIs for integration with other systems

Key Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* **Multi-format Support**: Process PDF, DOCX, TXT, HTML, and other document types
* **Scalable Architecture**: Handle large document collections efficiently
* **AI-Powered**: Leverage modern language models for content understanding
* **Extensible Design**: Plugin architecture for custom processing pipelines
