## Why

Effective documentation is crucial for the success of DocsToKG, a project that transforms documents into knowledge graphs using vector search and AI. Currently, the project lacks structured documentation, automated maintenance routines, and clear best practices. This hinders AI agents and human developers from quickly understanding project requirements and producing code that aligns with functional objectives. By establishing a comprehensive documentation framework, we can enhance collaboration, reduce onboarding time, ensure consistency, and enable AI agents to contribute more effectively to the codebase.

## What Changes

- **Establish structured documentation framework** with hierarchical organization in `docs/` directory
- **Implement automated maintenance routines** using tools like documentation generators and validation scripts
- **Adopt documentation best practices** including style guides, templates, and review processes
- **Create new documentation capability** in OpenSpec specs to formalize requirements
- **Integrate documentation maintenance** into development workflow

**BREAKING**: This introduces new directory structure and processes that will affect all contributors.

## Impact

- **Affected specs**: New `documentation` capability
- **Affected code**: All source files (will need documentation annotations), CI/CD pipeline (documentation validation), development workflow (new documentation steps)
- **Affected systems**: Repository structure, development process, contributor onboarding
