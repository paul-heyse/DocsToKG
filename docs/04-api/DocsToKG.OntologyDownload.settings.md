# 1. Module: settings

The configuration models previously exposed from
``DocsToKG.OntologyDownload.settings`` live inside the consolidated

*Configuration and settings* section there for `ConfigError`,
`DefaultsConfig`, `DownloadConfiguration`, logging utilities, and helpers for
loading YAML sources.
