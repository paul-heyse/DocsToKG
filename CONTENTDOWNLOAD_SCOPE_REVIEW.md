## QUALITY ASSESSMENT

### Strengths ✅

1. **Modular Design**: Both systems are cleanly separated with minimal coupling
2. **Comprehensive Docstrings**: Every module/class/function has clear documentation
3. **Type Safety**: Frozen dataclasses, type hints throughout
4. **Validation**: Post-init checks catch configuration errors early
5. **Testability**: Core logic isolated from I/O (can inject mocks easily)
6. **Production Patterns**: Follows SQLite best practices (IMMEDIATE txns, locks, etc.)
7. **Configuration**: YAML + env + CLI override pattern is standard and flexible
8. **Error Messages**: Clear, actionable error messages aid debugging

### Gaps ❌

1. **Integration Incomplete**: Core modules exist but aren't wired into pipeline
2. **Feature Gate Missing**: No ENV var check to enable/disable idempotency
3. **Adapter Coverage**: 3/7 adapters fully done; 4/7 need completion
4. **End-to-End Tests**: Module tests exist; integration tests missing
5. **Telemetry Sink**: Events defined but not connected to central sink
6. **CLI Integration**: No --fallback-* flags added to parser
7. **Helper Utilities**: HTML parser, robots.txt checker not yet implemented
8. **Documentation**: AGENTS.md not updated with fallback/idempotency instructions

### Risk Assessment

| Item | Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------|-----------|
| Idempotency schema | Low | Single transaction, idempotent (multiple runs safe) |
| Idempotency integration | Medium | Feature gate + staged rollout (disable by default) |
| Fallback orchestrator | Low | Well-designed threading pattern, isolated from adapters |
| Fallback adapters | Medium | 3/7 done; remainder need HTML parsing + API integration |
| Pipeline integration | High | Requires changes to runner.py + download.py |

## RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS

### Phase 1: Complete Fallback Adapters (2-3 days)

1. Implement DOI redirect adapter
   - Use existing URL canonicalization
   - Follow redirects with rate limiting
   - Extract PDF URL from final landing page

2. Implement landing scrape adapter
   - Use `lxml` or `beautifulsoup` for HTML parsing
   - Extract `<meta name=citation_pdf_url>`, `<link rel="alternate">`, `<a href="*.pdf">`

   ```

2. Call migration on runner startup

   ```python
   if ENABLE_IDEMPOTENCY:
       apply_migration(conn)
       cleanup_stale_leases(conn)
   ```

3. Integrate into `download.py`
   - Call `plan_job_if_absent()` at start
   - Wrap HTTP calls with `run_effect()`
   - Advance state through lifecycle
   - Handle errors by setting state='FAILED'

4. Add to CLI argument parser

   ```python
   --enable-idempotency
   --fallback-enabled
   --fallback-tier ...
   ```

### Phase 3: Testing + Telemetry (2-3 days)

1. Create integration tests
   - Feature gate ON/OFF paths
   - Crash recovery simulation
   - Multi-worker coordination

2. Connect telemetry sink
   - Emit fallback_attempt events
   - Track per-tier success rates
   - Calculate SLOs

3. Update AGENTS.md
   - Idempotency section with examples
   - Fallback tuning guide
   - Troubleshooting

### Phase 4: Rollout + Monitoring (1-2 days)

1. Ship with features disabled by default
2. Enable for 10% of runs, monitor
3. Gradually increase to 100%
4. Archive success metrics

## CONCLUSION

Both Optimization 8 (Data Model & Idempotency) and Optimization 9 (Fallback & Resiliency) are **substantially implemented** with high-quality, production-ready core components. The implementations closely match the specifications and demonstrate excellent software engineering practices.

**However**, the systems remain **disconnected from the download pipeline**. The module boundaries are clean enough that integration can proceed in parallel without breaking existing functionality. A phased rollout (feature gates, per-tier enablement, telemetry validation) will safely bring these systems into production.

**Estimated effort for full production deployment**: 1-2 weeks (2 engineers in parallel), with low risk due to isolation.
