## 🎓 Key Learning Points (from Planning)

1. **Pydantic v2 is the right choice** — Speed, features, ecosystem
2. **Domain decomposition improves clarity** — 10 sub-models vs 1 flat model
3. **Singleton caching is efficient** — Expensive parsing happens once
4. **Immutability prevents bugs** — frozen=True on all models
5. **Source precedence matters** — CLI → config → .env → env → defaults
6. **Testing fixtures are essential** — temp_env, settings_from_dict patterns
7. **Backward compatibility is achievable** — Via builders and exports
8. **Early validation saves debugging** — Catch errors at load time, not use time
