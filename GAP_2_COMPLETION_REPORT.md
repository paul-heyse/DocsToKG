# Gap #2: DocTags Runner Integration — Completion Report

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**
**Date**: October 21, 2025
**Commit**: `eba81ad6` (feat(doctags): Integrate DocTags with unified runner)

---

## 🎯 Objective

Integrate the DocTags stage (PDF and HTML conversion) with the unified runner infrastructure (`run_stage()`), replacing legacy ProcessPoolExecutor loops with the centralized orchestration kernel.

---

## ✅ Deliverables

### 1. Code Changes to `doctags.py`

**File**: `src/DocsToKG/DocParsing/doctags.py`

#### Changes Made

1. **Imports (Lines 340, 350)**
   - Added `StageOptions` to core imports
   - Added `run_stage` to core imports

2. **HTML Worker & Hooks (New, Lines 2417-2540)**
   - Created `_html_stage_worker()`: Proxies to `html_convert_one()` with runner integration
   - Created `_make_html_stage_hooks()`: Lifecycle hooks for HTML stage with manifest logging

3. **PDF Main Integration (Lines 2300-2342)**
   - Replaced ProcessPoolExecutor loop with `run_stage()` call
   - Created `StageOptions` with policy="cpu" (ProcessPool/spawn for CPU-intensive PDF conversion)
   - Updated summary logging to use `outcome` fields
   - Updated return statement to check `outcome.failed`

4. **HTML Main Integration (Lines 2944-2984)**
   - Replaced ProcessPoolExecutor loop with `run_stage()` call
   - Created `StageOptions` with policy="io" (ThreadPool for I/O bound HTML parsing)
   - Updated summary logging to use `outcome` fields
   - Updated return statement to check `outcome.failed`

### 2. Functional Impact

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **PDF Loop** | ProcessPoolExecutor + manual manifest | run_stage + hooks |
| **HTML Loop** | ProcessPoolExecutor + manual manifest | run_stage + hooks |
| **Concurrency** | CPU: ProcessPool, HTML: ProcessPool | CPU: ProcessPool, HTML: ThreadPool |
| **Manifest Writing** | Inline during loop | Via hooks (atomic) |
| **Resume Support** | Via WorkItem.satisfies() | Via runner (consistent) |
| **Error Handling** | Manual try/catch | Unified via runner |
| **Progress** | Manual tqdm bars | Built into runner |

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Lines Modified** | 320 |
| **Lines Added** | 187 |
| **Lines Deleted** | 133 |
| **New Functions** | 2 (_html_stage_worker,_make_html_stage_hooks) |
| **Files Changed** | 1 (doctags.py) |
| **Commit Hash** | eba81ad6 |

## 🔍 Verification

### Type Checking

- ✅ Imports properly added and available
- ✅ `StageOptions` and `run_stage` correctly typed
- ✅ `outcome` variable properly scoped

### Testing

- ✅ Core runner tests: 10/12 passing (2 pre-existing failures unrelated to this change)
- ✅ DocParsing core tests: All passing
- ✅ No regressions in existing tests

### Code Quality

- ✅ No new linting errors related to our changes
- ✅ Backward compatible (no breaking changes)
- ✅ Resume/force semantics preserved

## 📋 Design Details

### PDF Main Flow

```
pdf_main()
  ├─ Load config & resume state
  ├─ Build StagePlan via _build_pdf_plan()
  ├─ Create StageOptions (policy="cpu", workers=X)
  ├─ Get hooks via _make_pdf_stage_hooks()
  ├─ Call run_stage(plan, _pdf_stage_worker, options, hooks)
  │  ├─ Hook: before_stage (setup context)
  │  ├─ For each WorkItem:
  │  │  ├─ Hook: before_item
  │  │  ├─ _pdf_stage_worker processes item
  │  │  ├─ Hook: after_item (writes manifests)
  │  │  └─ Track timing/errors
  │  └─ Hook: after_stage (cleanup)
  ├─ Log summary with outcome metrics
  └─ Return 0 if outcome.failed == 0 else 1
```

### HTML Main Flow

```
html_main()
  ├─ Load config & resume state
  ├─ Build StagePlan via _build_html_plan()
  ├─ Create StageOptions (policy="io", workers=X)
  ├─ Get hooks via _make_html_stage_hooks()
  ├─ Call run_stage(plan, _html_stage_worker, options, hooks)
  │  ├─ Hook: before_stage (setup context)
  │  ├─ For each WorkItem:
  │  │  ├─ Hook: before_item
  │  │  ├─ _html_stage_worker processes item
  │  │  ├─ Hook: after_item (writes manifests)
  │  │  └─ Track timing/errors
  │  └─ Hook: after_stage (cleanup)
  ├─ Log summary with outcome metrics
  └─ Return 0 if outcome.failed == 0 else 1
```

### Policy Rationale

| Stage | Policy | Reason |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **PDF** | `cpu` | ProcessPool(spawn) — vLLM on GPU needs separate process space |
| **HTML** | `io` | ThreadPool — Docling is I/O bound, not fork-safe requiring processes |

---

## 🔒 Backward Compatibility

- ✅ Resume logic identical (uses `WorkItem.satisfies()`)
- ✅ Force logic identical (overrides satisfies)
- ✅ Manifest format unchanged
- ✅ Error handling preserved
- ✅ CLI interface unchanged
- ✅ Default behaviors preserved

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate (Today)

1. ✅ Commit Gap #2 code
2. Optional: Corpus parity test (compare old vs new manifests)
3. Optional: Performance regression check

### Near Term (This Week)

1. Code review of all Gap implementations
2. Merge all 5 gaps into main
3. Tag v0.x.x release (runner unified)
4. Update CHANGELOG

### Future Enhancements

1. SJF scheduling (shortest-job-first for heterogeneous workloads)
2. Adaptive concurrency (auto-tune workers)
3. Performance dashboards
4. Advanced monitoring
