## Part 2: Detailed Review Plan

### 2.1 Code Quality Review

**Files to Review**:
```
src/DocsToKG/ContentDownload/
├── urls.py                      # URL canonicalization core
├── urls_networking.py           # URL instrumentation
├── breakers_loader.py           # DNS optimization loader
├── breakers.py                  # Circuit breaker integration
├── ratelimit.py                 # Rate limiter integration
├── networking.py                # Request routing integration
├── download.py                  # Download integration
├── pipeline.py                  # Pipeline integration
├── resolvers/base.py            # Resolver base integration
├── resolvers/openalex.py        # OpenAlex resolver update
├── resolvers/unpaywall.py       # Unpaywall resolver update
├── resolvers/crossref.py        # Crossref resolver verification

```

**Checks**:
- [ ] Run ruff check (style violations)
- [ ] Run black --check (formatting)
- [ ] Run mypy (type safety)
- [ ] No unused imports
- [ ] No dead code
- [ ] Consistent naming conventions
- [ ] Line length reasonable (≤ 100 chars except docstrings)
- [ ] Complex functions documented

### 2.2 Type Safety Review

**Commands**:
```bash
mypy src/DocsToKG/ContentDownload/ --strict
```

**Checks**:
- [ ] All function signatures typed
- [ ] Return types specified
- [ ] No Any types without justification
- [ ] Optional types used correctly
- [ ] Dict/List types parameterized
- [ ] Type ignores documented
- [ ] No mypy errors/warnings

### 2.3 Functionality Review

**By Component**:

**URLs Module** (urls.py + urls_networking.py):
- [ ] canonical_for_index() produces RFC 3986 compliant URLs
- [ ] canonical_for_request() applies role-based filtering
- [ ] canonical_host() extracts normalized hostname
- [ ] STRICT mode rejects non-canonical inputs (when enabled)
- [ ] Instrumentation counters track normalization
- [ ] Offline mode support in place (for Hishel readiness)

**Breakers Loader** (breakers_loader.py):
- [ ] YAML loading works (test with cache.yaml format)
- [ ] Environment variable overlays work
- [ ] CLI argument overlays work
- [ ] Host key normalization uses IDNA 2008 + UTS #46
- [ ] Graceful fallback on IDNA errors
- [ ] Configuration validation catches errors
- [ ] Deferred imports resolve circular dependencies

**Legacy Code Removal** (all files with _normalize_host_key):
- [ ] breakers.py: 5 instances replaced
- [ ] ratelimit.py: 4 instances replaced
- [ ] download.py: 1 instance replaced
- [ ] pipeline.py: 1 instance replaced
- [ ] resolvers/base.py: 1 instance replaced
- [ ] All using deferred imports (no circular imports)
- [ ] No remaining host.lower() calls

**Integration Points**:
- [ ] networking.py calls URL canonicalization functions
- [ ] networking.py applies role-based headers
- [ ] pipeline.py uses canonical URLs for deduplication
- [ ] Breaker registry uses normalized host keys
- [ ] Rate limiter uses normalized host keys
- [ ] All integration tests passing

### 2.4 Testing Review

**Test Files**:
```
tests/content_download/
├── test_urls.py
├── test_urls_networking.py
├── test_breakers_loader.py
├── test_breakers_integration.py

├── test_cache_policy.py          # (May not exist yet)
└── test_cache_integration.py     # (May not exist yet)
```

**Checks**:
- [ ] All test files present
- [ ] pytest runs without errors
- [ ] 100% code coverage for new code
- [ ] Unit tests: functionality isolated
- [ ] Integration tests: end-to-end scenarios
- [ ] Edge cases covered (empty strings, None, special chars)
- [ ] Error cases tested (invalid input, exceptions)
- [ ] Fixtures properly set up/torn down
- [ ] No flaky tests
- [ ] Test names descriptive

**Commands**:
```bash
pytest tests/content_download/ -v --cov=src/DocsToKG/ContentDownload --cov-report=term-missing
```

### 2.5 Documentation Review

**Checks**:

- [ ] README.md reflects current architecture
- [ ] BREAKER_LOADER_IMPLEMENTATION.md complete and accurate
- [ ] RESOLVER_BEST_PRACTICES.md complete and accurate
- [ ] No TODO comments remaining (completed items)
- [ ] External references (RFC, libraries) documented

### 2.6 Backward Compatibility Review

**Checks**:
- [ ] Existing CLI arguments still work
- [ ] No breaking changes to public APIs
- [ ] Deferred imports don't break existing code
- [ ] Integration tests confirm everything working
- [ ] Legacy tests still passing (if any)
- [ ] No deprecation warnings (that weren't intentional)

### 2.7 Performance Review

**Checks**:
- [ ] canonical_for_index() is fast (< 1ms per URL)
- [ ] _normalize_host_key() is O(1) lookup
- [ ] Breaker policy lookup is O(1)
- [ ] No unnecessary imports (lazy loading where appropriate)
- [ ] No circular import performance issues
- [ ] Telemetry overhead minimal (< 1% CPU)

### 2.8 Security Review

**Checks**:
- [ ] No SQL injection vectors (SQLite in breakers_loader)
- [ ] No command injection vectors (env var handling)
- [ ] YAML loading uses safe_load (not load)
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials
- [ ] File permissions correct for config files
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive info
- [ ] IDNA error handling doesn't allow exploits
