export DOCSTOKG_RLIMIT_GLOBAL_INFLIGHT=2000

# Start service
python -m DocsToKG.ContentDownload.cli --rate-config /etc/docstokg/ratelimits.yaml ...
```

**Status**: âœ… READY

### Step 3: Post-Deployment Verification
```bash
# Monitor logs
tail -f logs/content_download.log | jq 'select(.stage=="rate-limiter")'

# Check metrics
curl -s localhost:9090/metrics | grep rate_limiter_

# Health check
python -m DocsToKG.ContentDownload.cli --dry-run --max 5
```

**Status**: âœ… OPERATIONAL

---

## Rollback Plan

If critical issues arise:

**Immediate (0-5 minutes)**:
- Set `DOCSTOKG_RLIMIT_GLOBAL_INFLIGHT=999999` to disable rate limiting
- No code changes required
- System continues operating

**Short-term (5-30 minutes)**:
- Revert to previous commit
- Rebuild and redeploy
- Verify system health

**Long-term (30+ minutes)**:
- Root cause analysis
- Fix and retest
- Deploy fix with updated procedures

**Expected Downtime**: <5 minutes with immediate rollback
