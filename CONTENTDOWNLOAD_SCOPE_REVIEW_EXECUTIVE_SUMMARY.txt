================================================================================

8-PHASE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP

Phase 1: Config + Schema (2h, 200 LOC) - FOUNDATION
  • StorageConfig (8 fields: backend, root_dir, layout, cas_prefix, etc.)
  • CatalogConfig (7 fields: backend, path, wal_mode, compute_sha256, etc.)
  • Database schema (documents + variants tables with 8 indexes)
  • Database initialization via schema.sql

Phase 2: Catalog Core (6h, 800 LOC) - STORAGE LAYER
  • DocumentRecord dataclass (11 fields, frozen/slots)
  • CatalogStore protocol (8+ methods)
  • SQLiteCatalog implementation with full CRUD
  • Idempotent register_or_get() ensuring (artifact_id, url, resolver) uniqueness

Phase 3: Storage Layouts (4h, 400 LOC) - PATH STRATEGIES
  • fs_layout.py: cas_path(), policy_path(), dedup_hardlink_or_copy()
  • s3_layout.py: stub for S3 integration (s3_upload, s3_verify, s3_delete)
  • Two-level CAS fanout: data/cas/sha256/ab/cdef...
  • Hardlink dedup on POSIX, fallback to copy on Windows

Phase 4: Operations (3h, 300 LOC) - GC & MIGRATION
  • gc.py: find_orphans(), retention_filter(), delete_orphan_files()
  • migrate.py: import_manifest() for backfill from manifest.jsonl
  • Dry-run support for all destructive operations
  • Comprehensive logging and auditability

Phase 5: Pipeline Integration (2h, 200 LOC) - WIRING
  • Modify download_execution.py finalize_candidate_download()
  • Compute SHA-256 (if enabled)
  • Choose final path (CAS vs policy path)
  • Register to catalog on success
  • Preserve atomic writes and all existing behavior

Phase 6: CLI Commands (5h, 500 LOC) - OPERATIONS INTERFACE
  • catalog import-manifest: backfill from JSONL
  • catalog show <artifact_id>: list all records for artifact
  • catalog where <sha256>: find all records with this hash
  • catalog dedup-report: list hashes with count > 1
  • catalog verify <record_id>: verify SHA-256 integrity
  • catalog gc: garbage collection with dry-run support

Phase 7: Tests (8h, 1,200 LOC) - VERIFICATION
  • test_catalog_register.py: CRUD operations, idempotence, stats
  • test_dedup_and_layout.py: CAS/policy paths, hardlink equality
  • test_catalog_verify.py: hash re-verification, tampering detection
  • test_catalog_gc.py: orphan finding, retention, metrics
  • test_cli_catalog.py: all 6 commands, output validation, error handling
  • >95% coverage target

Phase 8: Observability (2h, 200 LOC) - METRICS & LOGGING
  • catalog_metrics.py: 3 OTel counters
  • contentdownload_dedup_hits_total{resolver}
  • contentdownload_gc_removed_total
  • contentdownload_verify_failures_total
  • Integration with existing telemetry framework

================================================================================

QUALITY GATES (Per Phase)

All phases must achieve:
  ✅ 100% type-hinted (mypy --strict clean)
  ✅ 0 linting errors (ruff check, black --check)
  ✅ >95% test coverage (Phase 7 onwards)
  ✅ All docstrings present (100+ char descriptions)
  ✅ No hardcoded paths or secrets
  ✅ Atomic file operations preserved
  ✅ No breaking changes to existing API
  ✅ Backward compatibility maintained

================================================================================

RISK ASSESSMENT: LOW

Reasons:
  ✅ Design is crystal clear from 2 comprehensive scope documents
  ✅ Each phase is isolated and independently testable
  ✅ Catalog is opt-in (disabled by default in config)
  ✅ Existing pipeline untouched until Phase 5
  ✅ Rollback plan available (revert on main if phase fails)
  ✅ No external dependencies (uses stdlib + existing pkgs)
  ✅ Backward compatible (can be disabled per config)
  ✅ No SQL migration complexity (fresh schema)

================================================================================

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (All 8 from PR #9 § 10)

✅ Success outcomes register with (artifact_id, source_url, resolver) idempotence
   → Planned: Phase 2 (SQLiteCatalog.register_or_get with UNIQUE constraint)

✅ SHA-256 computation integrated; CAS or policy path used per config; atomic
   → Planned: Phase 5 (finalize_candidate_download with CAS/policy logic)

✅ Dedup works (hardlink/copy based on config); no extra download required
   → Planned: Phase 3 (dedup_hardlink_or_copy with POSIX/Windows fallback)

✅ CLI supports show/where/verify/dedup-report/gc/import-manifest
   → Planned: Phase 6 (6 Typer commands with human-readable output)

✅ OTel metrics for dedup hits, GC removals, verify failures
   → Planned: Phase 8 (3 counters with resolver labels)

✅ Tests green; behavior unchanged for users who disable catalog
   → Planned: Phase 7 (1,200 LOC tests); Phase 5 (config-based opt-in)

✅ Existing manifest.jsonl remains audit log; catalog is queryable index
   → Planned: Phase 4 (import_manifest for backfill); Phase 2 (catalog queries)

✅ Paths in catalog are URIs; S3-ready without record shape changes
   → Planned: Phase 3 (storage_uri as file:/// or s3:// URIs)

ARCHITECTURAL HIGHLIGHTS

From Scope Documents:

Flow: ResolverPipeline → Finalize (SHA-256, CAS/policy, atomicity) → 
      Catalog (register) → Telemetry (metrics) → Storage

Data Model: DOCUMENTS (core) + VARIANTS (optional) with idempotent composite key
  - (artifact_id, source_url, resolver) → 1:1 mapping
  - Supports multi-variant artifacts (PDF, HTML, supplement)

Dedup: 
  - CAS layout: file paths derived from SHA-256 (same hash → same path)
  - Hardlink on POSIX (inode sharing), copy/move on Windows
  - Saves disk space and download time for duplicate content

Concurrency:
  - Thread-safe register_or_get() with race-safe CAS logic
  - SQLite WAL mode for concurrent readers + single writer
  - Test verified for parallel workers

Migration:
  - import-manifest() for backfill from existing manifest.jsonl
  - Preserves history continuity
  - Optional SHA-256 computation on import

Observability:
  - 3 OTel metrics for dedup, GC, verify failures
  - Structured logging with correlation IDs
  - Integration with existing telemetry framework

================================================================================

RECOMMENDATIONS

1. ✅ PROCEED WITH FULL IMPLEMENTATION
   All scope requirements are clear, well-designed, and production-ready.
   The 2 scope documents provide sufficient detail for execution.

2. ✅ START WITH PHASE 1 (Config + Schema)
   This is the foundation layer. Once approved, can begin immediately.

3. ✅ EXECUTE PHASES SEQUENTIALLY
   Each phase builds on the previous. Maintain order for stability.

4. ✅ MAINTAIN QUALITY GATES
   100% type-safe, 0 lint errors, >95% tests across all phases.
   Non-negotiable for production code.

5. ✅ COMMIT AFTER EACH PHASE
   Incremental commits allow rollback if needed.
   Main branch stays stable throughout.

6. ✅ DEFER S3 FULL IMPLEMENTATION
   Phase 3 includes s3_layout.py as a stub/seam.
   Full S3 can be Phase 3.5 or follow-up PR.
   FS + CAS is production-ready without it.

================================================================================

NEXT STEPS

Upon Approval:

1. Approve this plan (current step)
2. Begin Phase 1 (Config + Schema) - ~2 hours
   → Create StorageConfig, CatalogConfig, schema.sql
3. Progress through all 8 phases sequentially
4. Integration testing (Phase 9, ~4 hours)
5. Documentation & deployment checklist

Current Status: ✅ READY FOR PHASE 1 EXECUTION

================================================================================

SUMMARY

This comprehensive review confirms that:

• All scope requirements are clearly understood
