# Phase 4: Idempotency Integration & Crash Recovery

**Status:** IN PROGRESS ðŸ”„

**Estimated Duration:** 10 days

**Target Completion:** TBD

---

## Executive Summary

Phase 4 integrates exactly-once semantics and crash recovery into the download pipeline. By leveraging deterministic idempotency keys and a state machine, we ensure:

- **Zero Duplicate Processing**: Same artifact never downloaded twice, even across crashes
- **Automatic Crash Recovery**: Stale jobs detected and recovered on startup
- **Multi-Worker Safety**: Safe concurrent processing without race conditions
- **Operation Ledger**: Complete audit trail of all operations

## Architecture Overview

### Idempotency Model

```
Job Idempotency:
  [work_id, artifact_id, canonical_url] â†’ job_key (SHA-256)
                                         â†’ UNIQUE constraint
                                         â†’ INSERT OR IGNORE

Operation Idempotency:
  [kind, job_id, context...] â†’ op_key (SHA-256)
                             â†’ INSERT OR IGNORE
                             â†’ Ledger table (artifact_ops)

State Machine:
  PLANNED â†’ LEASED â†’ HEAD_DONE â†’ RESUME_OK â†’ STREAMING 
         â†’ FINALIZED â†’ INDEXED â†’ DEDUPED â†’ SUCCESS
         â””â”€ FAILED, SKIPPED_DUPLICATE (terminal states)
```

### Integration Points

#### 1. **process_one_work() - Job Initialization**
```python
# Generate job key
job_key_val = job_key(artifact.work_id, artifact.id, canonical_url)

# Check if already completed
state = check_job_state(job_key_val)
if state == "SUCCESS":
    return {"skipped": True}  # Already done

# Acquire lease (PID-based)
acquire_lease(job_key_val, os.getpid())
```

#### 2. **stream_candidate_payload() - Operation Logging**
```python
# Log HEAD request
op_key_head = op_key("HEAD", job_key_val, url=url)
run_effect("HEAD", op_key_head, lambda: head_request(...))

# Log STREAM operation
op_key_stream = op_key("STREAM", job_key_val, url=url, range_start=0)
run_effect("STREAM", op_key_stream, lambda: stream_to_file(...))

# Advance state
advance_state(job_key_val, "STREAMING")
```

#### 3. **finalize_candidate_download() - Finalization**
```python
# Log finalization
op_key_finalize = op_key("FINALIZE", job_key_val, path=dest_path)
run_effect("FINALIZE", op_key_finalize, lambda: atomic_finalize(...))

# Advance to final state
advance_state(job_key_val, "FINALIZED")

# Release lease
release_lease(job_key_val)
```

#### 4. **Startup - Crash Recovery**
```python
# On app initialization
reconcile_stale_leases(timeout_seconds=3600)  # 1 hour default
# Marks stale leases as FAILED for retry
```

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 4.1: Core Integration (2 days)

**Deliverables:**
- Import idempotency functions into download.py
- Add job_key generation to process_one_work()
- Add op_key generation to stream_candidate_payload()
- Add op_key generation to finalize_candidate_download()

**Expected LOC:** ~60

**Key Functions:**
```python
from DocsToKG.ContentDownload.idempotency import (
    job_key,
    op_key,
    acquire_lease,
    release_lease,
    advance_state,
    run_effect,
    reconcile_stale_leases,
)
```

### Phase 4.2: Lease Management (2 days)

**Deliverables:**
- Implement acquire_lease() calls on job start
- Implement renew_lease() during streaming
- Implement release_lease() on completion
- Handle lease timeout scenarios

**Expected LOC:** ~40

**Key Logic:**
```python
# On job start
pid = os.getpid()
acquire_lease(job_key_val, pid)

# Periodically during streaming
renew_lease(job_key_val)

# On completion
release_lease(job_key_val)
```

### Phase 4.3: State Machine (2 days)

**Deliverables:**
- Call advance_state() at each milestone
- Validate state transitions
- Handle conflicts (e.g., state already advanced)

**Expected LOC:** ~30

**State Transitions:**
```
PLANNED â†’ LEASED â†’ HEAD_DONE â†’ RESUME_OK â†’ STREAMING 
       â†’ FINALIZED â†’ INDEXED â†’ DEDUPED â†’ SUCCESS
```

### Phase 4.4: Crash Recovery (2 days)

**Deliverables:**
- Call reconcile_stale_leases() on startup
- Implement recovery for abandoned jobs
- Add logging for recovery events

**Expected LOC:** ~20

**Recovery Logic:**
```python
# On app startup
stale_jobs = reconcile_stale_leases(timeout_seconds=3600)
for job_id in stale_jobs:
    LOGGER.info(f"Recovered stale job {job_id}, marking for retry")
```

### Phase 4.5: Testing & Verification (2 days)

**Deliverables:**
- Unit tests for key generation (determinism, collisions)
- Integration tests for state machine
- Crash recovery tests (multi-worker, timeout scenarios)
- End-to-end tests for exactly-once semantics

**Expected Test Count:** 30+ new tests
