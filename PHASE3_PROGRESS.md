## Phase 3A: Networking Hub Integration ✅

**Status**: COMPLETE & READY FOR PRODUCTION  
**Duration**: Completed in single session  
**Blocker Status**: Phases 3B & 3C now UNBLOCKED

### What Was Accomplished

#### 1. Core Integration ✅
- [x] Wired instrumentation calls into `request_with_retries()` in `networking.py`
- [x] Added 3 key instrumentation hooks:
  - `record_url_normalization()` → metrics tracking
  - `apply_role_headers()` → role-based Accept headers
  - `log_url_change_once()` → once-per-host logging
- [x] Extension fields added to all responses
- [x] Strict mode enforcement integrated

#### 2. Metrics & Observability ✅
- [x] Metrics collection implemented:
  - `normalized_total` (total URLs processed)
  - `changed_total` (URLs that differed)
  - `hosts_seen` (unique hosts)
  - `roles_used` (per-role counts)
- [x] Once-per-host logging (no spam)
- [x] Accessible via `get_url_normalization_stats()`

#### 3. Role-Based Headers ✅
- [x] Landing role: HTML-focused (`Accept: text/html, ...`)
- [x] Metadata role: JSON-focused (`Accept: application/json, ...`)
- [x] Artifact role: PDF-focused (`Accept: application/pdf, ...`)

#### 4. Testing ✅
- [x] 13 comprehensive integration tests
  - TestPhase3AIntegration (10 tests)
  - TestPhase3AHeaderShaping (3 tests)
- [x] All tests mocked (no real HTTP traffic)
- [x] All tests passing

#### 5. Documentation ✅
- [x] PHASE3A_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md
- [x] PHASE3A_STATUS.txt
- [x] Inline code comments
- [x] Integration guide

#### 6. Compatibility ✅
- [x] 100% backward compatible
- [x] No breaking changes
- [x] All imports verified
- [x] Pre-Phase-3A tests still pass

## Phase 3B: Resolver Integration (PENDING)

**Status**: READY TO START - Phase 3A ✅ prerequisite met  
**Estimated Duration**: ~3 hours  
**Can Run In Parallel**: YES (with Phase 3C)  
**Blocker For**: Phase 3D

### Planned Work

```
[PENDING] Update core resolvers to emit canonical_url
  ├─ openalex resolver
  ├─ unpaywall resolver
  └─ crossref resolver

[PENDING] Test resolver integration
[PENDING] Update remaining resolvers (batch 2)
[PENDING] Add per-resolver tests
```

### What Needs to Happen

1. **Resolver Updates**
   - Add `canonical_url = canonical_for_index(url)` to each resolver
   - Emit `canonical_url` in candidate emission
   - Maintain backward compatibility

2. **Testing**
   - Per-resolver validation tests
   - Integration with networking instrumentation
   - Verify metrics tracking

3. **Integration**
   - Verify canonical URLs flow through pipeline
   - Check deduplication accuracy
   - Validate response extensions

---

## Phase 3C: Pipeline Updates (PENDING)

**Status**: READY TO START - Phase 3A ✅ prerequisite met  
**Estimated Duration**: ~2 hours  
**Can Run In Parallel**: YES (with Phase 3B)  
**Blocker For**: Phase 3D

### Planned Work

```
[PENDING] Update ManifestUrlIndex
  └─ Use canonical URLs as primary key

[PENDING] Update dedupe logic
  └─ download.process_one_work() deduplication

[PENDING] Telemetry updates
  └─ Track both original and canonical URLs

[PENDING] Integration tests
  └─ Verify dedupe/pipeline integration
```

### What Needs to Happen

1. **ManifestUrlIndex**
   - Migrate from `original_url` to `canonical_url` keys
   - Update schema version

2. **Pipeline Deduplication**
   - Use `canonical_for_index()` in dedupe logic
   - Track original URL for manifest
   - Verify cache key alignment

3. **Telemetry**
   - Log both URLs in attempt records
   - Update manifest schema
   - Aggregate metrics correctly

---

## Phase 3D: Validation & Monitoring (PENDING)

**Status**: BLOCKED UNTIL Phase 3B & 3C complete  
**Estimated Duration**: ~1-2 hours  
**Prerequisites**: Phase 3A ✅, 3B, 3C

### Planned Work

```
[BLOCKED] End-to-end integration tests
[BLOCKED] Canary deployment
[BLOCKED] Metrics validation
[BLOCKED] Cache hit-rate measurement
```

### Success Criteria

- [ ] All integration tests passing
- [ ] Cache hit-rate improved by 10-15%
- [ ] Metrics showing expected patterns
- [ ] Dedupe accuracy ≥ 99%
- [ ] No regressions in download speed
- [ ] Strict mode catches non-canonical URLs

## Critical Path Timeline

```
Now          Phase 3A Complete ✅
   |
   ├─→ Phase 3B (3 hrs) ──────┐
   |                           ├─→ Phase 3D (1-2 hrs) → Production
   └─→ Phase 3C (2 hrs) ──────┘

Parallelizable: Phase 3B + 3C (can start simultaneously)
Sequential: Phase 3D (must follow 3B & 3C)
```

---

## Next Immediate Actions

### Option 1: Start Phase 3B (Recommended)
**Resolvers** are the content source; updating them ensures all incoming URLs are canonical from the start.

```bash
# Steps:
1. Start with canonical_url emission in openalex resolver
2. Add resolver tests
3. Verify networking instrumentation tracks canonical URLs
4. Repeat for unpaywall, crossref
```

### Option 2: Start Phase 3C (Alternative)
**Pipeline** improvements will benefit all workflows; can run in parallel with 3B.

```bash
# Steps:
1. Update ManifestUrlIndex schema
2. Modify download.process_one_work() dedupe logic
3. Add integration tests
4. Verify metrics align with Phase 3A observations
```

### Option 3: Both in Parallel (Optimal)
**Independent workflows** with separate concerns; no cross-dependencies.

---

## Deployment Readiness

### Phase 3A: ✅ PRODUCTION READY

- No environment variables required
- No dependency changes
- No database migrations
- Fully backward compatible
- Ready for immediate canary

### Phase 3B: PENDING (after complete)
### Phase 3C: PENDING (after complete)
### Phase 3D: PENDING (after 3B & 3C)
